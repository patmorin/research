We consider the problem of removing $c$ points from a set $S$ of $n$
points so that the resulting point set has the smallest possible
convex hull.  Our main result is an $O(\runtime)$ time algorithm
that solves this problem when ``smallest'' is taken to mean least area
or least perimeter. Here $C_r = {2r\choose r}/(r+1)$ is
the $r$th \emph{Catalan number}.

\section{Introduction}

Motivated by the problem of removing outliers in a data set, This
paper considers the following problem: Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points
in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with convex hull denoted by $\ch(S)$.  We consider
the problem of selecting a subset $S'\subset S$, $|S'|=c$ such that
the area, or perimeter, of $\ch(S\setminus S')$ is minimum.  We call
these problems the \emph{area-based}, respectively,
\emph{perimeter-based}, \emph{outlier removal problems}.  We are
particularly interested in the case when $c$ (the number of outliers)
is small.

\paragraph{Previous Work.} The outlier removal problems stated above
and similar problems are fairly well-studied problems in computational
geometry.  However, most work thus far has focused on the case when
$c$ is large. More specifically, most research has been on the problem
of finding a $k$ point subset (a $k$-cluster) $X\subseteq S$, $|X|=k$,
such that $\ch(X)$ has minimum area or perimeter. These are the same
problems studied in this paper except that $k=n-c$ and the research
has focused on designing efficient algorithms for small values of $k$.  

The problem of finding a subset of $S$ of size $k$ that has the least
perimeter convex hull was first considered over 20 years ago by Dobkin
\etal\ \cite{ddg83} who gave an $O(k^2n\log n + k^5 n)$ time
algorithm.  This algorithm can be improved to run in $O(k^2 n\log n +
k^4 n)$ time using techniques of Aggarwal \etal\ \cite{aiks89}.  Both
algorithms are based on the fact that the $k$ points that define the
solution are a subset of the $k'$ points that define some cell in the
order $k'$ \voronoi\ diagram, where $k'=\ceil{\pi (k-1)}$.  This
allows the problem to be solved by considering $O(k'n)$ subproblems
each of size $k'$.

The problem of finding a subset of $S$ of size $k$ that has the
minimum area convex hull has been considered by Eppstein \etal\
\cite{eorw92} and later by Eppstein \cite{e93} who give $O(kn^{3})$
and $O((k^3+\log n) n^2)$ time algorithms for this problem,
respectively.  The second algorithm (by Eppstein) uses the first
algorithm along with the fact that the $k$ points that define the
solution are ``close to'' one of the $n\choose 2$ line segments
defined by pairs of points in $S$.  This allows the problem to be
solved by considering $O(n^2)$ subproblems each of size $O(k)$.

\paragraph{New Results.}

For fixed values of $k$, the results above give $O(n\log n)$ and
$O(n^2)$ time algorithms for finding the $k$ point subset of $S$ with
minimum perimeter, respectively, area, convex hull.  However, when $k$
is close to $n$ the above algorithms require $\Omega(n^3)$ time.  In
this paper we consider the case when $k=n-c$ and show that
perimeter-based and area-based outlier removal problems can be solved
in $O(\runtime)$ time.  Here, $C_r={2r \choose r}/(r+1)$ is the famous
$r$th Catalan number.  Thus, for any fixed $c$, both problems can be
solved in $O(n\log n)$ time.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: \ldots

\section{Preliminaries}

The \emph{convex layers} of $S_0,\ldots,S_k$ of $S$ are defined as
follows: $S_0$ is the subset of $S$ on the boundary of $\ch(S)$.
$S_i$, for $i\ge 1$ is the subset of $S$ on the boundary of
$\ch(S\setminus\bigcup_{j=0}^{i-1} S_j)$.  The convex layers of $S$
can be computed in $O(n\log n)$ time in several different ways
\cite{X,Y,Z} or, more simply, the first $c$ convex layers can be
computed in $O(cn\log n)$ time by repeated applications of any
$O(n\log n)$ time convex hull algorithm.  For the remainder of this
paper we will use the notation $p_{i,j}$ to denote the $(j\bmod
|S_i|)$th point of $S_i$.

Consider a point $p_{0,j}\in S_0$.  If we remove $p_{0,j}$ from $S$
then the boundary of $\ch(S\setminus\{q\})$ can be obtained either by
computing two tangents joining $p$ and $r$ to $S_1$ (when the triangle
$pqr$ has points of $S$ in its interior) or by joining $p$ and $r$
(when the triangle $pqr$ is empty of points from $S$.  If $S_1$ is
stored in an array then computing the necessary tangents and deciding
which of the two cases applies can be done in $O(\log n)$ time
\cite{X}.

\section{The Algorithm}

In this section we present our algorithms for solving the
perimeter-based and area-based outlier removal algorithms. Our
solution to both problems is to enumerate all the $C_c$ combinatorial
types of solutions of size $c$.  For each such type, we then use a
dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal solution of that
type in $O(c^2 n\log n)$ time.  Before we present the general
algorithm, it will be helpful to discuss the special cases $c=1$ and
$c=2$ to illustrate the general principle.

\subsection{Removing 1 Outlier}

The case $c=1$ asks us to remove 1 point of $S$ so that the convex
hull of the resulting set is minimum.  This can be solved as follows:
We compute the two convex layers $S_0$ and $S_1$ in $O(n\log n)$ time.
We then determine, for each point $p_{0,j}\in S_0$ the difference in
area between $\ch(S)$ and $\ch(S\setminus\{p_{0,j}\})$.  To do this we
compute the new vertices $p_{1,k},\ldots,p_{1,\ell}$ of $S_1$ that
appear on the boundary of $\ch(S\setminus\{p_{0,j}\})$ when we delete
$q$.  We then compute the area of
$\ch(\{p_{0,j-1},p_{0,j+1}\}\cup\{p_{1,k},\ldots,p_{1,\ell}\})$ and
subtract this value from the area of the triangle
$p_{0,j-1}p_{0,j}p_{0,j+1}$.   This
process takes $O(t_j+\log n)$ time, where
$t_j=|\{p_{1,k},\ldots,p_{1,\ell}\}|$.

To analyze the overall running time of this algorithm we observe that
any point $p_{1,k}\in S_1$ appears in at most two triangles
$p_{0,j-1},p_{0,j},p_{0,j+1}$ and 
$p_{0,j},p_{0,j+1},p_{0,j+2}$.  Stated another way, 
\[  
     \sum_{j=0}^{|S_0|-1} t_j \le 2|S_1|\le 2n \enspace .
\]
Thus, the overall running time of this algorithm is 
\[
     T(n) = \sum_{j=0}^{|S+0|-1} O(t_j+\log n) = O(n\log n) \enspace ,
\]
as claimed.

\subsection{Removing 2 Outliers}

Next we consider the case $c=2$.  In this case, the optimal solution
$S'$ is of one of three following forms:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $S'$ contains two consecutive points of $S_0$.
\item $S'$ contains two non-consecutive points of $S_0$.
\item $S'$ contains one point of $S_0$ and one point of $S_1$.
\end{enumerate}

The solutions of Type~1 can be found in much the same way as the
algorithm for the case $c=1$.  For each $j\in\{0,\ldots,|S_0|\}$ we
compute the difference in area between $\ch(S)$ and
$\ch(S\setminus\{p_{0,j},p_{0,j+1}\}$.  The analysis remains exactly
the same as before except that, now, each point of $S_1$ can appear in
at most $3$ subproblems.  Thus, the best solution of Type~1 can be
found in $O(n\log n)$ time.


The solutions of Type~3 can also be found in a similar way.  For each
$p_{0,j}\in S_0$ we remove $p_{0,j}$ to expose a sequence
$p_{1,k},\ldots,p_{1,\ell}$ of $S_1$ and compute the area of
$\ch(S\setminus\{p_{0,j}\})$.  We then remove each of
$p_{1,k},\ldots,p_{1,\ell}$ in turn (exposing a chain of points from
$S_2$) and compute the area of the resulting convex hull.  To analyze
the cost of all these, we observe that each point $p_{1,j}\in S_1$
appears in at most 2 subproblems because there are at most 2 points in
$S_0$ whose removal causes $p_{1,j}$ to appear on the convex hull.
Similarly, for each point $p_{2,j}\in S_2$ there are at most 2 points
of $S_1$ whose removal causes $p_{2,j}$ to appear on the convex hull.
Thus, each point in $S_1$ appears in at most 2 subproblems and each
point in $S_2$ appears in at most $4$ subproblems.  The overall
running time of this algorithm is therefore bounded by
\[
    O\left(n\log n + |S_0|\log n + 2|S_1|\log n + 4|S_2|\right) = O(n\log n) \enspace ,
\]
as required.

Finally, we consider solutions of Type~2.  To find these we compute,
for each $p_{0,j}\in S_0$ the difference $x_j$ between the area of
$\ch(S\setminus\{p_{0,j}\})$ and $\ch(S)$ using the technique
described for the case $c=1$.  In this way, we reduce the problem to
finding two indices $0\le j_1,j_2< |S_0|$ with $j_1<j_2-1$ such that
$x_{j_1}+x_{j_2}$ is maximum.  We do this 
by computing the following quantity 
\[
     S_j = \max\{x_{j_1}+x_{j_2} : 
       \mbox{$j\le j_1,j_2\le |S_0|$ and $j_1 < j_2-1$}\} \enspace ,
\]
which can be computed in $O(|S_0|)$ time using the recurrence
\[
    S_j = \max{S_{j+1}, x_{j} + \max\{x_{j+2}},\ldots,x_{|S_0|-1}
\]


\subsection{Removing $\mathbf{c}$ Outliers}

\section{Conclusions}

The running times of our algorithms depend exponentially on the value
of $c$.  Is it possible to find algorithm that are polynomial in $c$
but that still run in $O(n\log n)$ time for fixed values of $c$?

The outlier removal problems we study in this paper are two special
cases of the following \emph{general outlier removal} problem.  Given
any function $f$ that maps subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ onto $\mathbb{R}$
we want to find, for a given set $S$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ a
subset $S'\subset S$ of size $c$ such that $f(S\setminus S')$ is
minimum.  Functions $f$ of particular interest include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(X)$ is the radius of the smallest disk contain $X$,
\item $f(X)$ is the diameter of $X$ ($f(X)=\max\{\|ab\|:a,b\in X\}$), and
\item $f(X)$ is the variance of $X$ ($f(X)=\sum_{a\in X} \| am \|^2$
where $m=\sum_{a\in X} a/|X|$.
\end{enumerate}
For the first two functions, it is easy to obtain $O(3^c n)$ and
$O(2^cn\log n)$ time algorithms, respectively, using the fact that the
smallest enclosing disk and the diameter are defined by at most 3,
respectively, 2, points of $S$.  Are there are algorithms for these
problems whose running time depends only polynomially on $c$?
