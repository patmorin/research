\begin{thm}
Let $S$ be a set of $r$ points and let $H_0,\ldots,H_{t-1}$ be a
set of lines such that the orthogonal projection of $S$ onto $H_{j}$
gives exactly $i+j$ distinct values, for each $j\in\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$.
Then $t \le \tau i$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
First we observe that the number of points, $r$, satisfies 
\[   r \ge i+t-1 
\]
because the points of $S$ project onto $i+t-1$ distinct values in $H_{t-1}$.  Furthermore, the projections of $S$ onto $H_0$ and $H_1$ imply that the points of $S$ are contained in the intersection of two sets of parallel lines $L_0$, of size $i$ and $L_1$ of size $i+1$, so
\[
   r \le i(i+1) \enspace .
\]
Each projection direction $H_j$ defines a set $L_j$ of $i+j$ parallel lines,
each of which contains at least one point of $S$.  In total, this defines
a set $L=L_0\cup\cdots\cup L_{t-1}$ of
\[
   \ell(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{t-1} (i+j) = ti + t(t-1)/2 \le ti + t^2/2 \enspace .
\]
lines.  The total number of incidences between the these lines and
the points in $S$ is $tr$.

Define a geometric graph $G$ having $r+2$ vertices consisting
of the points in $S$ plus two points ``at infinity,'' as in
Figure~\ref{fig:G}. Observe that $G$ is a graph with no self-loops and no
parallel edges. The number of
edges in $G$ is exactly $tr + \ell(t)$.
The Crossing Lemma \cite{XX} then implies that, either
\[
  tr +\ell \le 7.5(r+2)
\]
or that
\begin{equation}
  \cn(G) \ge \gamma\cdot\frac{(tr+\ell(t))^3}{(r+2)^2} \enspace . \label{eq:cn}
\end{equation}
In the former case, we readily establish that $t \le 7.5i + O(1)$,
so we may assume that Eq.~(\ref{eq:cn}) holds.  (In fact, we can establish this from the inequality $\ell \le 7.5(r+2))$, which will be important later.)

Observe that we have a drawing of $G$ so that the only crossings between
edges occur where lines in $L$ intersect each other.  The total number of intersecting pairs of lines in $L$ is 
\[
  \chi(t) \le i^2t^2/2 + it^3/2 + t^4/8 \enspace .
\]
%However, each point of $S$ eliminates $\binom{t}{2}$ of these intersecting
%pairs.  Therefore, the crossing number $\cn(G)$ of $G$ satisfies
%\[
%  \cn(G) \le \chi(t) - \binom{t}{2}r = i^2t^2/2 + it^3/2 + t^4/8 - \binom{t}{2}r \enspace .
%\]
Combining this with Eq.~\ref{eq:cn} and rewriting, we obtain 
\[
  \chi(t)  \ge \gamma\cdot\frac{(tr+\ell(t))^3}{(r+2)^2} \enspace .
\]
Let $G_{s}$, $s\in\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$, be defined like $G$, but only with respect to the set of lines in $L_0,\ldots,L_s$.  Then, by the same reasoning as above,
\[
  \chi(s) \ge \gamma\cdot\frac{(sr+\ell(s))^3}{(r+2)^2} 
\]
for all $s\in\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$.

Select $s=i$ and $t=ci$ for some constant $c$ to be determined later
Rewriting, we get
\[
  \begin{aligned}
  s 
   &\le \frac{\chi(s)^{1/3} (r+2)^{2/3} - \ell(s)}{\gamma^{1/3}r} \\ 
   &\le \frac{\chi(s)^{1/3} (r^{2/3}+2^{2/3}) - \ell(s)}{\gamma^{1/3} r} \\
   & = \frac{\chi(s)^{1/3}r^{2/3}+\chi(s)^{1/3}2^{2/3} - \ell(s)}{\gamma^{1/3} r}  \\
   & = \frac{\chi(s)^{1/3}r^{2/3}+(2\ell(s))^{2/3} - \ell(s)}{\gamma^{1/3} r} 
    & \mbox{ (since $\chi(s) \le \ell(s)^2$)} \\
   &\le \frac{\chi(s)^{1/3}}{(\gamma r)^{1/3}}
    & \mbox{ (for sufficiently large $\ell(s)$)} \\
   &\le \frac{(i^2s^2/2 + is^3/2 + s^4/8)^{1/3}r^{2/3}}{\gamma^{1/3} r}  \\
   &\le \frac{O((is)^{2/3}) + O(i^{1/3}s) + s^{4/3}/2}{(\gamma r)^{1/3}}  \\
   & = \frac{O((is)^{2/3}) + O(i^{1/3}s) + s^{4/3}/2}{(\gamma (i+t-1))^{1/3}}  \\
   & = \frac{O(i^{4/3}) + O(i^{4/3}) + i^{4/3}/2}{(\gamma (i+t-1))^{1/3}}  
    & \mbox{ (since $s=i$)} \\
   & \le \frac{O(i^{4/3}) + O(i^{4/3}) + i^{4/3}/2}{(\gamma ci)^{1/3}}  
    & \mbox{ (since $t=ci$)} \\
   & < i = s
  \end{aligned}
\]
for a sufficiently large, but still constant, choice of $c$.
