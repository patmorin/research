\begin{abstract}
  We consider a new definition of fault-tolerance for $t$-spanners that
  we dub robustness.  A $t$-spanner is robust if the removal of any $k$
  vertices leaves $n-f(k)\cdot o(n)$ vertices whose induced subgraph is
  a $t$-spanner.

\section{Introduction}

For a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset $S\subseteq V$ of $G$'s vertices,
$G[S]$ denotes the subraph of $G$ induced by $S$ and $G\setminus
S=G[V\setminus S]$ is the graph obtained by removing the elements of $S$
from $V$.

Let $V\subset \R^d$ be a set of $n$ points in $\R^d$.  A connected graph
$G=(V,E)$ is a $t$-spanner of $V$ if, for every pair $x,y\in V$,
\[
  \frac{\|xy\|_G}{\|xy\|} \le t \enspace ,
\]
where $\|xy\|$ denote the Euclidean distance between $x$ and $y$ and
$\|xy\|_G$ denotes the length of the Euclidean shortest path from $x$
to $y$ that uses only edges in $G$.

The graph $G$ is an \emph{$(f(k),g(n))$-robust $t$-spanner} of $V$ if,
for every subset $S\subseteq V$, there exists a superset $S'\supseteq S$,
$|S'|\le f(|S|)\cdot g(|V|)$, such that $G\setminus S'$ is a $t$-spanner.
If $g(n)=1$, then we say simply that $G$ is an $f(k)$-robust $t$-spanner.
Intuitively, killing the vertices in any set $S$ leaves a small
number, $f(|S|)$, of vertices stranded but most of the graph remains
a $t$-spanner.

Robustness is related to, but different from, $k$-fault tolerance.
A \emph{$k$-fault-tolerant} $t$-spanner $G=(V,E)$ has the property that
$G\setminus S$ is a $t$-spanner for any subset $S\subseteq V$ of size
at most $k$.  At a minimum, a $k$-fault-tolerant spanner must remain
connected after the removal of any $k$ vertices.  This immediately implies
that any $k$-fault-tolerant spanner with $n$ vertices has $\Omega(kn)$
edges.  Several constructions of $k$-fault-tolerant spanners having
$O(kn)$ edges exist \cite{cz04,lns02,l99}.


\section{One-Dimensional Point Sets}

In this section, we consider constructions of robust $t$-spanners for
1-dimensional point sets.  Throughout this section $V=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$
is a set of real numbers with $x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_n$.

\subsection{An $O(k\log k)$-robust spanner with $O(n\log n)$ edges}

We now consider the following graph, $G_{2\times}=(V,E)$ which is
closely related to the hypercube.   The edge set, $E$, of $G_{2\times}$
consists of
\[
  E = \{x_ix_{i+2^j} : j\in\{0,\ldots,\floor{\log n}\},\, 
        i\in\{1,\ldots,n-2^j\} \} \enspace .
\] 
Notice that $G_{2\times}$ is a 1-spanner since it contains every every
edge of the form $x_i,x_{i+1}$, for $i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$. Furthermore,
$G_{2\times}$ has size $O(n\log n)$ since every vertex has degree at most
$2\floor{\log n}+2$.  We now prove an upper-bound on the robustness of
$G_{2\times}$ by using the probabilistic method.

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{better-upper-bound-1d}\thmlabel{klogk-1d}
  Let $V\subset \R$ be any set of $n$ real numbers.  Then there exists
  an $O(k\log k)$-robust $1$-spanner of $V$ of size $O(n\log n)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Consider any set $S\in\binom{V}{k}$.  Select a random integer
  $r\in\{0,\ldots,2^{\ceil{\log n}}-1\}$ and consider the subgraph,
  $G'$, of $G_{2\times}$ consisting only of the edges of the form
  $(x_i,x_{i+\ell})$ where $i-r$ is a multiple of $\ell$.  (For readers
  with a background in data structures, this subgraph looks a lot like a
  skiplist in which $x_r$ appears at the top level; see \figref{g-prime}.)

  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{robust-1}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The graph $G'$}
    \figlabel{g-prime}
  \end{figure}

  For a vertex $x_i\in S$, let $j$ be the largest integer such that
  $i-r$ is a multiple of $2^j$.  Then we say that $x_i$ \emph{kills}
  the vertices $x_{i-2^{j}+1},\ldots,x_{i+2^{j}-1}$ in $G'$; see
  \figref{killing}.  When this happens, the \emph{cost} of $x_i$ is
  $c(x_i)=2^{j+1}-1$.  Observe that, unless $i<2^{j}$ or $i>n-2^{j}$,
  $G'$ contains the edge $x_{i-2^{j}}x_{i+2^{j}}$ that ``jumps over''
  all the vertices killed by $x_i$.  Therefore, if we define $S'$ to be
  the set of all vertices killed by vertices in $S$, then $G'\setminus S'$
  (and hence also $G_{2\times}\setminus S'$) is a 1-spanner.
  
  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{robust-2}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Constructing the set $S'$ (whose elements are denoted
    by $\times$)
      from the set $S$ (whose elements are denoted by \textbullet).}
    \figlabel{killing}
  \end{figure}
  
  We say that a vertex $x\in S$ is \emph{cheap} if $c(x) < 4k$ and
  \emph{expensive} otherwise.  We call our choice of $r$ a \emph{failure}
  if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathcal{A}$: any vertex of $S$ is expensive; or
    \item $\mathcal{B}$: the total cost of all cheap vertices exceeds
      $16k\log k$
  \end{enumerate}
  We declare our choice of $r$ a \emph{success} if neither $\mathcal{A}$
  nor $\mathcal{B}$ holds.  Observe that, in the case of a success, we
  obtain a set $S'$, $|S'|\le ck\log k$, such that $G_{2\times}\setminus
  S'$ is a 1-spanner.  Therefore, all that remains is to show that the
  probability of success is greater than 0.
  
  We first note that 
  \[
     \Pr\{\mathcal{A}\} \le k/4k = 1/4 \enspace ,
  \]
  since the number of vertices of $G'$ incident on edges of length
  greater than $4k$ is at most $n/4k$.

  To upper-bound the total expected cost of cheap vertices, we note that,
  if $x\in S$ kills $2^{j+1}-1$ vertices, then $x$ is incident on an
  edge of length $2^{j}$.  The probability that this happens is at most
  $1/2^{j}$.  Letting $S^{c}$ denote the set of cheap vertices in $S$,
  the total expected cost of all cheap vertices is at most
  \begin{eqnarray*}
     \E\left[\sum_{x\in S^{c}}c(x) \right] 
    &\le&  k\sum_{j=0}^{\floor{\log (4k)}} (2^{j+1}-1)/2^j \\
     &\le& k\sum_{j=0}^{\floor{\log (4k)}} 2^j \\
     &<& 8k\log k \enspace .
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Therefore, by Markov's Inequality, $\Pr\{\mathcal{B}\}\le 1/2$.
  By the union bound
  \[
     \Pr\{\mbox{$\mathcal{A}$ or $\mathcal{B}$}\} \le 1/4+ 1/2 < 1
  \enspace .
  \]
  for sufficiently large $k$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{A General Construction}
\seclabel{iterated}

Let $k_0\ge 1$ be a constant and let $f:\R\rightarrow\R$ be any function
that is weakly convex, increasing over the interval $[k_0,\infty)$,
and such that $f(k_0+1)-f(k_0) > 1$.  Let $f^{i}(k)$ be the function $f$
iterated $i$ times on the initial value $k$, i.e.,
\[
   f^{i}(k) = \underbrace{f(f(f(\cdots f}_{i}(k)\cdots))) \enspace .
\]
We use the convention that $f^0(x) = k_0$ for all $x$.
Then we define the \emph{iterated
$f$-inverse function}
\[
   f^*(n) = \max\{i : f^{i}(k_0) \le n\} \enspace .
\] 
Notice that, for any $k> k_0$, there exists $i$ such that
\[
   f^i(k_0) < k \le f(f^i(k_0)) \enspace .
\]
In particular, the sequence $k_0,f(k_0),f^2(k_0),\ldots,$ contains
a value $f^{i+1}(k_0)$ such that
\[
      k  \le  f^{i+1}(k_0) < f(k) \enspace .
\]
Another important property is that, since $f(k)$ is increasing
and convex, $f(x)/x$ is non-decreasing: For every $\Delta\ge 0$,
$f(x+\Delta)/(x+\Delta) \ge f(x)/x$.

\newcommand{\upen}[1]{\llceil#1\rrceil}

For a positive number $x$, we define $\upen{x}=2^{\ceil{\log x}}$, as the
smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to $x$.  Given such a function,
$f$, we define the graph $G_f=(V,E)$ to have the edge set:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    E &=& \quad\left\{ x_ix_{i+1} : i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\} \right\} \\
     && {} \cup \left\{ x_{i}x_{i+\upen{f^j(k_0)}} : j\in\{0,\ldots,f^*(n)\},\,
        i\in\{1,\ldots,n-\upen{f^j(k_0)}\} \right\}
\end{eqnarray*}
The graph $G_f$ clearly has $O(nf^*(n))$ edges.  The following theorem shows that this graph is robust:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{general-1d}
  Let $f$, $f^*$, $k_0$, and $G_f$ be defined as above.  Then the graph
  $G_f$ has $O(nf^*(n))$ edges and is
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $O(f(4k)f^*(k))$-robust; and 
    \item $O(f(4k))$-robust if $f(k)\in\Omega(k2^{\sqrt{\log k}})$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We proceed as in the proof of \thmref{klogk-1d}.  Select a random
  integer $r\in\{0,\ldots,\upen{f^{f^*(n)+1}(k_0)}\}$.  We consider the
  subgraph $G'$ of $G_f$ that contains only the edges $x_ix_{i+\ell}$
  where $i-r$ is an integer multiple of $\ell$.  We say that an edge
  $x_ix_{i+\ell}$ has \emph{span} $\ell$.

  For an integer $i$, let $j$ be the smallest integer such that $i-r$ is
  not a multiple of $\upen{f^j(k_0)}$.  Informally, if there exists any
  edge that jumps over $x_i$, then an edge of span $\upen{f^j(k_0)}$
  jumps over $x_i$.  Then we say that a vertex $x_i\in S$ kills
  $x_{i-p},\ldots,x_{i+q}$ where
  \begin{eqnarray*}
     p&=& ((i-r) \bmod \upen{f^j(k_0))}+1 \text{ and } \\
     q&=& ((r-i) \bmod \upen{f^j(k_0))}-1 \enspace .
  \end{eqnarray*}
  
  Define $c(x_i)$ as the number of vertices killed by $x_i$.  We say
  that $x_i$ is \emph{expensive} if $c(x_i) > f(4k)$ and \emph{cheap}
  otherwise.  Notice that, if $x_i$ is expensive, then $x_i$ is incident
  on an edge whose span is at least $4k$.  The number of such vertices
  is only $n/4k$.  Therefore, the probability that $S$ contains any
  expensive vertex is at most $1/4$.  All that remains is to bound the
  expected cost of all cheap vertices. Letting $S^c$ denote the set of
  cheap vertices in $S$, we obtain
  \begin{align*}
     \E\left[\sum_{x\in S^c} c(x)\right] 
      & \le  k \sum_{j=0}^{f^*(4k)} \upen{f^{j+1}(k_0)}/\upen{f^j(k_0)} \\
      & \le  2k \sum_{j=0}^{f^*(4k)} f^{j+1}(k_0)/f^j(k_0) \\
      & =  2k \sum_{j=0}^{f^*(4k)} f(f^{j}(k_0))/f^j(k_0) \\
      & \le  2k \sum_{j=0}^{f^*(4k)} f(4k)/4k 
           & \text{(since $f(x)/x$ is non-decreasing)} \\
      & \le  (1/2)f(4k)f^*(4k) \enspace .
  \end{align*}
  Again, Markov's Inequality implies that the probability that the total
  cost of all cheap vertices exceeds $f(4k)f^*(4k)$ is at most $1/2$.
  Therefore, the probability of finding a set $S'$ of size at most
  $f(4k)f^*(4k)$ is at least
  \[  
     1 - 1/2 - 1/4 > 0 
  \]
  which proves the existence of such a set $S'$.
  
  To prove the second part of the theorem, we proceed exactly the
  same way, except that the sequence $f^{j+1}(k_0)/f^j(k_0)$ becomes
  geometrically increasing,\footnote{This is most easily seen by
  taking $f(k) = k\delta^{2\sqrt{(\log k)/(\log\delta)}+1}$.  It is
  straightforward to verify, then that $f^j(\delta) = \delta^{(j+1)^2}$,
  so that $f^{j+1}(\delta)/f^j(\delta)= \delta^{2j+3}$, so the sequence
  is exponentially increasing.} so it is dominated by its last term.
  This yields:
  \begin{align*}
  \E\left[\sum_{x\in S^c} c(x)\right] 
      & \le  k \sum_{j=0}^{f^*(4k)} \upen{f^{j+1}(k_0)}/\upen{f^j(k_0)} \\
      & \le  2k \sum_{j=0}^{f^*(4k)} f^{j+1}(k_0)/f^j(k_0) \\
      & \le  2ck\left(\frac{f(f^{f^*(4k)}(k_0))}{f^{f^*(4k)}(k_0)}\right) 
            & \text{(since the sum is geometric)} \\
      & \le  2ck\left(\frac{f(4k)}{4k}\right) 
            & \text{(since $f(x)/x$ is non-decreasing)} \\
      & \le  (c/2)f(4k) \enspace ,
  \end{align*}
  as required.
\end{proof}


Applying \thmref{general-1d} with different functions $f(k)$ yields the
following results.
\begin{cor}
  For any set $V$ of $n$ real numbers, and any constant $\eps >0$,
  there exists $f(k)$-robust 1-spanners with
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(k)\in O(k\log k)$ and $O(n\log n)$ edges;
    \item $f(k)\in O(k(1+\eps)^{\sqrt{\log n}})$ and $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$
      edges; and
    \item $f(k)\in O(k^{(1+\eps)})$ and $O(n\log\log n))$ edges.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{cor}


\subsection{Lower Bounds}

In this section, we give lower-bounds on the number of edges in
$f(k)$-robust $t$-spanners.  These lower-bounds hold already for a
specific 1-dimensional point set, therefore they apply dimensions.

\section{A Lower Bound for Linear Robustness}

We begin by focusing on the hardest case, $f(k) \in O(k)$.

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{simple-lower-bound-1d}
  Let $V=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and let $t\ge 1$ be a constant.  Then any
  $O(k)$-robust $t$-spanner of $S$ has $\Omega(n\log n)$ edges.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Fix an even natural number $k$ and consider some
  $i\in\{ck,\ldots,n-ck\}$.  We claim that if $G=(V,E)$ is a
  $ck$-robust\footnote{Note that we have gone from $O(k)$-robust in the
  statement of the theorem to $ck$-robust in the proof.  This does not
  cause a problem so long as we only consider values of $k$ greater
  than some constant $k_0$ hidden in the $O$ notation.} $t$-spanner,
  then $G$ has at least $k/2$ edges, $xy$, such that $x < i < i+k/2 <
  y$ and such that $y-x \le ctk$.  If this is not the case, then there
  exists a set $S$, $|S|\le k$, such that any edges of $G$ with one
  endpoint to the left of $S$ and one endpoint to the right of $S$
  have length at least $ctk$.

  In particular, for any $S'\supseteq S$, with $|S'|\le ck$, there will
  exist two vertices $x,y\not\in S'$, with $\|xy\|\le ck$ such that the
  only path from $x$ to $y$ in $G\setminus S'$ uses an edge of length
  greater than $ctk$.  Thus, $G\setminus S'$ is not a $t$-spanner.

  Applying the above argument to $i=ck+2jtck$, for
  $j\in\{0,\ldots,\floor{(n-ck)/2tck}\}$ implies that $G$ contains
  $\Omega(n/tc)$ edges whose length is in the range $[k/2,ctk]$.
  Applying this argument for $k\in\{\ceil{(2tck_0)^{j}} :
  j\in\{0,\ldots,\floor{(\log n)/\log(2tck_0)}\}$ proves that, for any
  constants $c,k_0,t>1$, $G$ has $\Omega(n\log n)$ edges.
\end{proof}


\subsection{A General Lower Bound}\seclabel{generalized}

Using the iterated functions from \secref{iterated}, we obtain a whole
class of lower-bounds.

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{general-lower-bound-1d}
  Let $k_0$, $f$, and $f^*$ be defined as in \secref{iterated}, and let
  $S\subset \R$ be any set of $n$ real numbers.  Let $S=\{1,\ldots,n\}$
  and let $t\ge 1$ be a constant.  Then any $(f(k),1)$-robust $t$-spanner
  of $S$ has $\Omega(nf^*(n))$ edges.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
  The proof is similar to the proof of \thmref{simple-lower-bound-1d}.
  We need only consider $f(k)=\omega(n)$ since, otherwise we can apply
  \thmref{simple-lower-bound-1d}.  We group the edges of the graph
  $G$ into $\Omega(f^*(n))$ classes and show that each class contains
  $\Omega(n)$ vertices.  In this case, the edges in each class have
  lengths in a range of the form $[f^i(k_0),tcf^{i}(k_0)]$.  For large
  enough $i$, these classes do not overlap since $f(k)=\omega(n)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  Let $V=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and let $c>1$ be any constant.  Then any
  $f(k)$-robust 1-spanner with
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(k)\in O(k\log k)$ has $\Omega(n\log n/\log\log n)$ edges;
    \item $f(k)\in O(kc^{\sqrt{\log n}})$ has $\Omega(n\sqrt{\log n})$
      edges; and
    \item $f(k)\in O(k^{c})$ has $\Omega(n\log\log n))$ edges.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{cor}

Note that the lower-bounds in Parts~2 and 3 of this corollary match the
corresponding upper-bounds while the lower-bound in Part~1 is off by a
factor of $\log\log n$.


\section{Higher Dimensions}

In this section, we give a family of constructions for point sets
$V\subset\R^d$, $d\ge 1$.  These constructions make use of dumbbell
tree spanners \cite[Chapter~11]{ns07}.  A \emph{dumbbell tree spanner}
of $V$ is a set of $O(1)$ binary trees $\mathcal{T}=\{T_1,\ldots,T_p\}$.
Each binary tree $T_i$ has $n$ leaves, one for each vertex of $S$.
Each of $T_i$'s internal nodes also stores a point of $S$, and no point
of $S$ is stored in more than one internal node of $T_i$.  These trees
have the property that, for any two points $x,y\in S$, there exists some
tree $T_i$ such that the path from $x$ to $y$ in $T_i$ has length at
most $t'\|xy\|$, where $t'>1$ is a parameter.  Thus, the graph $G=(S,E)$
obtained by taking the union of all edges in all trees is a $t'$-spanner.

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{dd}
  Let $k_0$, $f$, and $f^*$ be defined as in \secref{iterated}.
  Let $S\subset \R^d$ be any set of $n$ points in $\R^d$.  Then, for any
  constant $t>1$,  there exists a $O(kf(k))$-robust $t$-spanner of $S$
  with $O(nf^*(n))$ edges.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof} 
  Fix a value $k$ and recall that, in any binary tree, $T$, with $n$
  nodes, there exists a vertex whose removal disconnects $T$ into at
  most 3 components each of size at most $n/2$.  Repeatedly applying
  this fact yields a set of $O(n/k)$ vertices whose removal disconnects
  $T$ into components of size at most $k$; see \figref{dumbbell-chop}.
  Perform this decomposition for each of the trees $T_1,\ldots,T_p$ in a
  dumbbell tree spanner to obtain a set of $X$ of $O(n/k)$ vertices whose
  removal disconnects every tree in $T$ into components each of size at
  most $k$.  Using any of the $k$-fault tolerant spanner constructions
  discussed in the introduction, we can construct a $k$-fault tolerant
  $t'$-spanner for $X$ having $O(k|X|)=O(n)$ edges.  Let $G_k=(V,E_k)$
  denote the graph whose edge set contains all edges of the dumbbell
  spanner and all edges of the $k$-fault tolerant spanner on $X$.
  
  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{dumb-1}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A dumbbell tree decomposed in components of size $O(k)$
    by the removal of a set $X$ of $O(n/k)$ vertices (each denoted
    by $\circ$).}
    \figlabel{dumbbell-chop}
  \end{figure}
  
  Suppose that we are now given a set $S\subseteq V$, $|S|\le k$.
  Any vertex $x\in S$ appears at most twice in each tree $T_i$.  We say
  that $x$ kills all the vertices in any component of $T_i\setminus X$
  that contains $x$.  Furthermore, if $x\in X$, the $x$ kills the (at most
  2) components whose roots have $x$ as a parent.  The total number of
  vertices killed by $x$ is therefore $O(k)$; see \figref{dumbbell-kill}.

  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{dumb-2}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The set $S$ (whose elements are denoted by \textbullet) kill
      $O(|S|k)$ vertices in each dumbbell tree.}
    \figlabel{dumbbell-kill}
  \end{figure}
  
  Let $S'$ be the set of all vertices killed by all vertices in $S$ and
  consider some pair of vertices $x,y\in V\setminus S'$.  There exists
  a tree $T_i$ such that the path in $T_i$ from the leaf containing $x$
  to the leaf containing $y$ has length at most $t'\|xy\|$.  If the
  leaves of $T_i$ containing $x$ and $y$ are in the same component of
  $T_i\setminus X$ then the path in $T_i$ from $x$ to $y$ is also a path
  in $G_k\setminus S'$ and this path has length $t'\|xy\|$.

  If $x$ and $y$ are in different components of $T_i\setminus X$ then
  $G_k\setminus S'$ contains a path, from $x$ up to the lowest ancestor,
  $x'$, of $x$ that appears in $X$.  Similarly, $G_k\setminus S'$ contains
  a path from $y$ up to the lowest ancestor, $y'$, of $y$ that appears
  in $X$.  Finally, since $G_k$ contains a $k$-fault tolerant $t'$-spanner
  on the vertices of $X$, and $|S|\le k$, there is a path from $x'$ to
  $y'$ of length at most $t'\|x'y'\|$.  Therefore, $G_k\setminus S'$,
  contains a path from $x$ to $y$ of length at most $(t')^2\|xy\|$.
  Taking $t'=\sqrt{t}$ shows that $G_k\setminus S'$ is a $t$-spanner.

  We have just shown how to construct a graph $G_k$ that has $O(n)$
  edges and is $O(k^2)$ robust provided that $|S|\le k$.  To obtain
  a graph that is $kf(k)$-robust for any value of $k$, we take the
  graph $G$ containing the edges of each $G_k$ for $k\in\{f^i(k_0) :
  i\in\{0,\ldots,f^*(k)\}\}$.  The graph $G$ has $O(nf^*(n))$ edges.
  For any set $S\in \binom{V}{k}$, we can apply the above argument
  on the subgraph $G_{k'}$ with $k \le k' < f(k)$, to show that $G$
  is $(O(kf(k)),1)$-robust.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Linear Size Robust Spanners}

Finally, we show that linear size robust spanners exist.

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{linear-size}
  If $(f(k),g(n))$-robust $t$-spanners with $O(n s(n))$ edges exist for
  all $V\subset\R^d$, then $(f(k),s(n)g(n))$-robust $t$-spanners with
  $O(n)$ edges exist for all $V\subset\R^d$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Perform the same dumbbell tree decomposition used in the proof of
  \thmref{dd} to obtain a set $X$ of $O(n/s(n))$ nodes whose removal

The following corollary is obtained by combining \thmref{linear-size}
with some of our upper-bound constructions:
\begin{cor}
  There exist linear size
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $(O(k\log k),O(\log n))$-robust $1$-spanners of any
      $V\subset \R$;
    \item $(O(k^{1+\eps}),O(\log\log n))$-robust $1$-spanners of any
      $V\subset \R$;
    \item $(O(k^2\log k), O(\log n))$-robust $t$-spanners of any
      $V\subset \R^d$; and
    \item $(O(k^{2+\eps}), O(\log\log n))$-robust $t$-spanners of any
      $V\subset \R^d$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{cor}

\section{Summary}

We have introduced the notion of $(f(k),g(n))$-robust $t$-spanners and
given upper and lower-bounds on the number of edges in such spanners.
Our lower bounds show that, if $g(n)\in O(1)$, then any such spanner
must have a super-linear number of edges, even in one dimension.
Our 1-dimensional constructions nearly match this lower-bound except
when the function $f$ is nearly linear.

We understand the situation less clearly in two and higher dimensions.
The lower bounds show that $f(k)$-robust $t$-spanners must have
$\Omega(nf^*(n))$ edges, but we have only been able to obtain
$O(kf(k))$-robust $t$-spanners with $O(nf^*(n))$ edges.  Closing this
gap is the main open problem left by this work.

Another fundamental open problem has to do with the number of edges needed
in an $O(k)$-robust $t$-spanner.  We have no upper-bound lower than the
trivial $O(n^2)$ and the only lower-bound is $\Omega(n\log n)$.  This is
true even if we restrict our attention to constructing a $t$-spanner
for the 1-dimensional point set $V=\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

%This weaker result is no longer used
%The following theorem shows that $G$ is also $(O(k^2),1)$-robust.
%This theorem is not tight; later we will show that $G$ is in fact
%$(O(k\log k),1)$-robust. Nevertheless, the proof of this theorem
%can be considered as a warm-up to the proof of the more abstract
%\thmref{general-upper-bound-1d}.
%
%\begin{thm}[Simple 1-d Upper Bound]\thmlabel{upper-bound-1d}
%Let $V\subset \R$ be any set of $n$ real numbers.  Then there exists an
%$(O(k^2),1)$-robust $1$-spanner of $S$ of size $O(n\log n)$.
%\end{thm}
%
%\begin{proof}
%We will prove that $G$ is a robust $1$-spanner. Consider any
%$S\in\binom{V}{k}$, with $k\le \sqrt{n}$.  Let $d=2^{\ceil{\log (k+1)}}$
%and observe that $k < d < 2k+2$ and that the edge $x_ix_{i+d}$ is in $G$
%for every $i\in\{1,\ldots,n-d\}$.
%
%We say that $x_i,\ldots,x_{i+r}$ form a \emph{good block} if $r\ge
%2d-1$ and $S$ contains no element of $x_i,\ldots,x_{i+r}$.  We focus
%our attention on the set of maximal good blocks.  Note that the number
%of maximal good blocks is at most $k+1$ and that the total number of
%vertices contained in these blocks is at least $n-k(2d-1)=n-O(k^2)$.
%We will show that there exists a set $S'\supseteq S$ that avoids all but
%$2(d-1)$ vertices from each good block, and such that $G\setminus S'$
%is a 1-spanner.
%Therefore, the size of $S'$ is at most $O(k^2)-2(d-1)(k+1)=O(k^2)$.
%
%Initially our set $S'$ contains all vertices in $S$, and
%we will add at most $d-1$ vertices from the beginning and
%end of each block.  Between any two consecutive good blocks,
%$x_i,\ldots,x_{i+r}$ and $x_j,\ldots,x_{j+s}$, $G$ contains $d$
%vertex disjoint paths, $P_1,\ldots,P_{d-1}$ each of which begins
%at a vertex in $x_{i+r-d+1},\ldots,x_{i+r}$ and ends at a vertex in
%$x_{j},\ldots,x_{j+d-1}$.  (For example, one of these paths consists of
%$x_i,x_{i+d},x_{i+2d},\ldots,x_{i+cd}$, for some integer $c$.)
%
%Since $d > k$, at least one path, say $P_1$, does not use any vertices
%of $S$.  If $P_1$ begins at $x_k$ and ends at $x_\ell$ then we add
%to $S'$ all vertices in 
%$x_{k+1},\ldots,x_{\ell-1}$ that are not included in $P_1$.  Observe that adds,
%to $S'$, at most $d-1$ of the first $d$ vertices of each block
%and at most $d-1$ of the last $d$ vertices of each block.  Therefore,
%the number of vertices added to $S'$ from all good blocks is at most
%$2(d-1)(k+1)$, as claimed.
%
%Let $x_{i_1},\ldots,x_{i_{n'}}$ denote the vertices in $V\setminus
%S'$, ordered from left to right.  None of these vertices are in $S'$,
%and for each $j\in\{1,\ldots,n'-1\}$, $i_{j+1}-i_{j}\in\{1,d\}$, so the
%edge $x_{i_j}x_{i_{j+1}}$ is present in $G$.  Therefore $G\setminus S'$
%is a 1-spanner.
%\end{proof}
