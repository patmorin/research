For a set $A$ of hyperplanes in $\R^d$ and two points $p,q\in\R^d$,
define the $A$-distance from $p$ to $q$, denoted $\|pq\|_A$, as the
number of hyperplanes in $A$ that separate $p$ from $q$.  Define the
$A$-ball of radius $r$ centered at $p$ as
\[ 
   B_A(p,r) = \{q\in\R^d : \|pq\|_A \le r\} \enspace .
\]

\begin{lem}[Welzl --- Lemma 2.1]\lemlabel{welzl}
Let $A$ be an arrangement of $n$ lines in the plane, let $0\le r\le
n/2$, and let $p$ be a point in the interior of a face of $A$.  Then,
\[
    |B_A(p,r) \cap V(A)| \ge {r+1 \choose 2} \enspace .
\]
\end{lem}

Here is a first extension to $\R^d$:
\begin{lem}
Let $A$ be an arrangement of $n$ planes in $\R^d$ ($d\ge 2$),  let
$0\le r\le n/2$, and let $p$ be a point in the interior of a cell of
$A$.  Then,
\[
    |B_A(p,r) \cap V(A)| \ge \frac{2^{d-1}r^d}{d!d!} \enspace .
\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on $d$, with the base case being
\lemref{welzl}.

Select a directed line $\ell$, containing $p$, not intersecting any
$(d-1)$-dimensional face of $A$ and such that the number of 
intersections of $\ell$ with
$A$ on each side of $p$ is at least $r$.  (The existence of such a
line is guaranteed by a simple continuity argument.)  Let
$\pi_0,\ldots,\pi_{r}$ be the hyperplanes of $A$ that intersect 
$\ell$ after $p$ ordered by increasing distance from $p$.

The inductive hypothesis and the triangle inequality imply that, on
the hyperplane
$\pi_i$, there are at least
\[
  \frac{2^{d-2}(r-i)^{d-1}}{(d-1)!(d-1)!} 
\]
vertices of $A$ whose $A$-distance from $p$ does not exceed $r$.
Counting this way, we count 
\[
  \sum_{i=0}^r \frac{2^{d-2}i^{d-1}}{(d-1)!(d-1)!} 
     \ge \frac{2^{d-2}r^{d}}{d!(d-1)!}
\]
vertices of $A$ that are at $A$-distance at most $r$ from $p$.
Repeating the same argument on the hyperplanes
that intersect $\ell$
before $p$ doubles the above quantity.  Since this counts each vertex
of $A$ at most $d$ times we obtain the desired result.
\end{proof}
