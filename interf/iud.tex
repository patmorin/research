  We show that, in any constant dimension $d$, given a set of $n$
  i.u.d. points in the $d$ dimensional cube, it is possible, with high

\section{Introduction}


Let $V=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ be a set of $n$ points in $\R^d$ and let
$G=(V,E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$.  The graph $G$ defines a set,
$B(G)$, of closed balls $B_1,\ldots,B_n$, where $B_i$ has center $x_i$
and radius
\[
   r_i = \max\{\|x_ix_j\| : j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\} \enspace .
\]
In words, $B_i$ is just large enough to enclose all of $x_i$'s neighbours
in $G$.  We define the \emph{interference} at a point, $p$, as the
number of
these balls that contain $p$, i.e.,
\[
    I(p,G) = |\{B\in B(G) : p\in B\}| \enspace .
\]
We define the \emph{(maximum receiver-centric) interference} of $G$ as the
maximum inteference at any vertex of $G$, i.e.,
\[
   I(G) = \max\{I(x,G) : x\in V\} \enspace .
\]
One of the goals of network design is to build, given $V$, a connected
graph $G=(V,E)$ such that $I(G)$ is minimized.  Thus, it is natural to consider the interference as a property of a given point set, $V$, defined as
\[
  I(V) = \min\{I(G) : \mbox{$G=(V,E)$ is connected}\} \enspace .
\]
The purpose of current paper is to prove the following result:
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{main}
  Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points independently and uniformly distributed
  in $[0,1]^d$.  Then, with high probability, $I(V)\in O((\log n)^{1/3})$.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Related Work}

In this section, we survey previous work on the problem of bounding
the interference of worst-case and random point sets.  A summary of the
results described in this section is given in \figref{related}.  In the statements of all results in this section, $|V|=n$.

The definition of interference used in this paper was introduced by
von~Rickenbach \etal\ \cite{vR05} who proved upper and
lower bounds on the interference of one dimensional point sets:
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{sqrtnlower}
For any integer $d\ge 1$, there exists $V\subset\R^{d}$, such
that $I(V)=\Omega(n^{1/2})$.
\end{thm}
The point set, $V$, in this lower-bound consists of any sequence of
points $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, all on a line, such that $\|x_{i+1}x_i\| \le (1/2)\|x_{i}x_{i-1}\|$,
for all $i\in\{2,\ldots,n-1\}$.  That is, the gaps between consecutive
points decrease exponentially.

This lower bound is matched by an upper-bound:
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{twod-upper}
For all $V\subset\R$, $I(V)\in O(n^{1/2})$.
\end{thm}
The upper bound in \thmref{twod-upper} is obtained by selecting $n^{1/2}$
vertices to act as \emph{hubs}, connecting the hubs into any connected
network and then having each of the remaining nodes connect to its
nearest hub.  This idea was extended to two and higher dimensions
by Halld\'orsson and Tokuyama \cite{ht08}, by using a special type of
$(n^{-1/2})$-net as the set of hubs:
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{sqrtn2d}
For all $V\subset\R^2$, $I(V)\in O(n^{1/2})$.  
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{sqrtndd}
  For any constant $d\ge 3$, and for all $V\subset\R^d$, $I(V)=O((n\log
  n)^{1/2})$.
\end{thm}

Several authors have shown that the interference of a point set is
related to the (logarithm of) the ratio between the longest and shortest
distance defined by the point set.  In particular, different versions
of the following theorem have been proven by Halld\'orsson and Tokuyama
\cite{ht08}, and Khabbazian, Durocher, and Haghnegahdar
\cite{kdh11}:
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{log}
  For any constant integer $d\ge 1$, and for all $V\subset\R^d$
  $I(V)=O(\log D)$, where $D=\max\{\|xy\|: \{x,y\}\subseteq V\}/\min\{\|xy\|:
  \{x,y\}\subseteq V\}$.
\end{thm}
(A version of this theorem even applies when $V$ is a set of elements in a metric space of bounded doubling dimension \cite{msz11}.)
The \emph{minimum spanning tree} of $V$ is the connected graph, $\mst(V)$,
of minimum total edge length.  At least two of the proof of \thmref{log} proceed by showing that $I(\mst(V))=O(\log D)$.

\thmref{log} suggests that point sets with very high interference are
unlikely to occur in practice.  Kranakis \etal\ \cite{kkmns10} show
that that high interference is unlikely to occur in random point sets
in one dimension:
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{sqrtlogn}
  Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points independently and uniformly distributed
  in $[0,1]$.  Then, with high probability, $I(\mst(V))\in \Theta((\log
  n)^{1/2})$.
\end{thm}
Note that, in this one-dimensional case, the minimum spanning tree,
$\mst(V)$, is simply a path that connects the points of $V$ in order,
from left to right.  The lower-bound in \thmref{sqrtlogn} is proven
by showing that, with high probability, $V$ contains a subsequence
of points like that used in the proof of \thmref{sqrtnlower},
whose length is $\Omega((\log n)^{1/2})$.  Combining the proofs of
Theorems~\ref{thm:sqrtnlower} and \ref{thm:sqrtlogn} one obtains the
following result:
\begin{thm}
  Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points independently and uniformly distributed
  in $[0,1]$.  Then, with high probability, $I(V)\in \Omega((\log
  n)^{1/4})$.
\end{thm}

In higher dimensions, Khabbazian, Durocher, and Haghnegahdar use their
version of \thmref{log} to show:
\begin{thm}
  Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points independently and uniformly distributed
  in $[0,1]^d$.  Then, with high probability, $I(\mst(V))\in O(\log n)$.
\end{thm}
This result follows from two observations: (1)~no pair of points in $V$
is at distance greater than $\sqrt{d}$, and (2)~with high probability,
no pair of points in $V$ is at distance less than $(\pi n)-2$.  Therefore,
with high probability
\[
   D \le \sqrt{d}(\pi n)^2 = O(n^2)
\]
and applying \thmref{log} completes the proof.

In the remainder of this paper, we prove \thmref{main}.

\section{Proof of \thmref{main}}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \thmref{main}]
For ease of exposition, we will prove the theorem for $d=2$, and mention,
later, the modifications required for the cases $d=1$ and $d\ge 3$.
Partition $[0,1]^2$ into squares of area $1/nt$ for some value $t$
to be specified later.  Let $N_i$ denote the number of points that
are contained in the $i$th such square.  Then $N_i$ is binomial with
mean $\mu=1/t$.  Recall Chernoff's Bounds \cite{c52} on the tails of
binomial random variables:
\[
  \Pr\{N_i \ge (1+\delta)\mu\} 
    \le \left(\frac{e^\delta}{(1+\delta)^{1+\delta}}\right)^\mu \enspace .
\]
In our setting, we have, 
\begin{align*}
  \Pr\{N_i \ge k\} 
    & = \Pr\{N_i \ge kt\mu\} \\
    & \le \left(\frac{e^{kt}}{(kt)^{kt}}\right)^{1/t} \\
    & = \frac{e^{k}}{(kt)^{k}} \\
    & \le \frac{1}{t^{k}} & \text{for $k\ge e$} \\
    & \le \frac{1}{n^{c+2}} & \text{for $t=2^{(\log n)^{1/3}}$ and $k=(c+2)(\log n)^{2/3}$.} \\
\end{align*}
Note that the number of square in the partition is no more than $nt\le
n^2$, for sufficiently large $n$.  Therefore, by the union bound, the
probability that there exists any square containing more than $k$ points
is at most $n^{-c}$.

Within each square of our partition, we apply the method of Hald\'orsson
and Tokuyama \cite{htXX} (\thmref{sqrtn2d} or \thmref{sqrtndd}).  This
connects the vertices in the $i$th square into a connected graph $G_i$
with $I(G_i)=O(\sqrt{N_i})$.  In fact, a somewhat stronger result holds,
namely that $\max\{I(x,G_i) : x\in\R^2\}=O(\sqrt{N_i})$.  Notice that
each edge in $G_i$ has length at most $\sqrt{2/nt}$.  Stated another
way, in $\bigcup_i G_i$, any point, $x$, receives interference only
from cells within distance $\sqrt{2/nt}$ of the cell containing $x$.
There are only 13 such cells, so
\[
  \max\left\{I\left(x,\bigcup_iG_i\right) : x\in\R^2\right\}=O(\sqrt{k}) 
    = O((\log n)^{1/3})
\]
with high probability.

Thus far, the points within each square are connected to each other, and
the maximum interference, over all points in $\R^2$ is $O(\sqrt{k})$.
To connect the squares to each other, we select one point from each
non-empty square and connect these using a minimum spanning tree, $T$.
What remains is to show that the additional interference caused by the
addition of the edges of $T$ does not exceed $O((\log n)^{1/3})$.

Suppose that $I(x,T)=k$, for some point $x\in\R^2$.  There are at most 4 verticers in $T$ whose distance to $x$ is less than $\sqrt{1/nt}$.  Therefore, by \thmref{log}, $T$ must contain edges of length at least $\sqrt{1}{nt}$.
