\section{Introduction}

The study of crossings drawings of graphs has a long history.
\emph{Euler's Formula} states that the maximum number of edges in a
planar graph with $n$ vertices is $3n-6$.  Using Euler's Formula and
careful counting, Ajtai \etal\ \cite{S} showed that any plane drawing of
a graph with $n$ vertices and $m\ge 4n$ edges has at least $c m^3/n^2$
crossing pairs of edges, for some constant $c$.  Using this result,
the same authors showed that the maximum number of planar graphs that
can be embedded any fixed set of $n$ points is $2^{O(n)}$

The lower bound, $cm^3/n^2$, on the number of crossings in a plane drawing
has since become known as the ``the \emph{Crossing Lemma}'' or ``the Crossing
Number Inequality.''  Szekely \cite{s} showed that this inequality
can be used to give very simple proofs of many results in incidence
geometry, including a proof of the Szemeredi-Trotter Theorem on point-line
incidences.  Szekely's method has since been used for many combinatorial
geometry problems; the most famous of these applications is probably the
result of Dey \cite{d98} on the maximum number $k$-sets of a point set.

Ajtai \etal's proof of the Crossing Lemma uses the probabilistic method
in the sense of Chvatal \cite{cXX}: The proof works by counting the
number of crossings in two different ways.  More recently, a ``from the
book'' proof of the Crossing Lemma that uses a more literal application
of the probabilistic method to obtain a better constant, $c$, was
discovered by Chazelle, Sharir, and Welzl (See Aigner and Ziegler
\cite[Theorem~XX]{azXX}).  Pushing this technique even further, Pach
\etal\ \cite{pdxx} currently hold the record for the largest constant,
$c$.

The goal of the present paper is to extend the results of Ajtai
\etal\ to graph drawings in higher dimensions.  In particular, we
extend their results to graphs drawn on grids.  The $d$-dimensional
\emph{$X_1\times\cdots\times X_d$ grid} is the point set
\[  \Z(X_1,\ldots,X_d) = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_d): 
      \mbox{$x_i\in\{1,\ldots,X_i\}$ for all $i\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$}\}
	\enspace .\]
The \emph{volume} of the $X_1\times\cdots\times X_d$ grid is
$\prod_{i=1}^d X_i$, i.e,. the number of points in the grid.
A ($d$-dimensional) \emph{geometric (grid) graph}, $G$, is a graph with
vertex set $V(G)\subseteq \Z(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ and such that, for any
edge $uw\in E(G)$, the open line segment with endpoints $u$ and $w$
does not include any point in $V(G)$.

Throughout this paper, for two vertices $u$ and $w$ in a geometric graph,
$G$, we will use the notation $uw$ to refer to the open line segment
with endpoints $u$ and $w$ and to the edge $uw\in E(G)$, if present.
Two edges $uw$ and $xy$ in a geometric graph \emph{cross} if they have a
point in common.  When this happens, we say that $uw$ and $xy$ generate
a \emph{crossing}.  We define $\crs(G)$ as the number of crossings
in $G$.\footnote{Note that this is different from the planar crossing
number, usually denoted $\mathrm{cr}(G)$, that is the minimum number of
crossings in any drawing of the (non-geometric) graph $G$.}  We say that
$G$ is \emph{non-crossing} if $\crs(G)=0$.  Finally, we define
\[ \crs_d(n,m)=\min\left\{\crs(G):\mbox{%
   $V(G)\subseteq\Z(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$,
   $\prod_{i=1}^d x_i\le n$,
   and $|E(G)|=m$}
   \right\} \enspace .
\]
That is, $\crs_d(n,m)$ is the minimum number of crossings in any geometric
graph having $m$ edges and whose vertices are contained in a grid of
volume at most $n$.

We are also interested in the maximum number, $\ncs_d(n)$, of non-crossing
geometric graphs that can be drawn on any particular grid of volume $n$.
That is,
\[
  \ncs_d(n) = \max\left\{
     \left|\left\{G:\mbox{$V(G)\subseteq\Z(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$
            and $\crs(G)=0$} \right\}\right| :
    \mbox{$\prod_{i=1}^d x_i \le n$} \right\} \enspace .
\]

Results on plane drawings of graphs have immediate implications
for $\crs_2(n,m)$ and $\ncs_2(n)$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Euler's Formula implies that $\crs_2(n,3n-5)\ge 1$,
  \item  Ajtai \etal's Crossing Lemma implies that $\crs_2(n,m)\ge
  cm^3/n^2$ for $m\ge 4n$, and
  \item  Ajtai \etal's upper-bound of $2^{O(n)}$ on the number of planar
  graphs that can be drawn on any point set implies that $\ncs_2(n)\le
  2^{O(n)}$.
\end{enumerate}

Czyzowicz \etal\ \cite{cXX} show that the maximum number of
edges in a non-crossing $d$-dimensional grid drawing is at most
$(2^d-1)n-\Theta(n^{(d-1)/d})$. This result is analagous to Euler's
Formula in that it shows that such graphs have a linear number of edges.
It also implies, for example, that $\crs_d(n,(2^d-1)n)\ge 1$.  Since
Euler's Formula is the main property of planar graphs used by Ajtai \etal\
to prove their results, it seems reasonable that bounds similar to those
of Ajtai \etal\ should hold for $d$-dimensional geometric grid graphs.

\subsection{New Results}

In the current paper, we study $\crs_d(n,m)$ and $\ncs_d(n)$ for $d\ge 3$
and prove the results shown in \tabref{results}.

%In this paper, we show that there exists constant $c_1,c_2,c_3>0$ such that, 
%for all $m> c_3n$
%\[
%   c_1(m^2/n)\log\log(m/n) \le g(n,m) \le c_2(m^2/n)\log(m/n) \enspace .
%\]
%The proof of the lower bound is given in \secref{lower-bound} and the
%upper bound is given in \secref{upper-bound}.

  \tablabel{results}
\end{table}

These results show that the situation in three and higher dimensions is
significantly different than in two dimensions. For all $d \ge 4$, and
$m\ge 2(2^d-1)n$, $\crs_d(n,m)\in \Theta(m^2/n)$ and even $\crs_3(n,m)$
is with a logarithmic factor of $\Theta(m^2/n)$.  For $d\ge 4$, the
bounds on $\crs_d(n,m)$ are strong enough to show that $\ncs_d(n)\in
2^{\Theta(n\log n)}$.  Thus, the number, $2^{\Theta(n\log n)}$, of
non-crossing graphs that can be drawn on a $d$-dimensional grid having $n$
points is much more than the number,  $2^{\Theta(n)}$,  of non-crossing
graphs that can be drawn on any planar point set of size $n$.

In three dimensions, our bounds on $\crs_3(m,n)$ differ by a factor of
$\log(m/n)/\log\log(m/n)$.  We have also been unable to determine any
non-trivial bounds on $\ncs_3(n)$.  (The trivial bounds $\ncs_3(n)\ge
2^{\Omega(n)}$ and $\ncs_3(n)\le 2^{O(n\log n)}$ are inherited by
the (easy to prove directly) lower and upper bounds on $\ncs_2(n)$
and $\ncs_4(n)$, respectively.)  These gaps in our knowlege are an
intriguing direction for future research that is discussed further in
\secref{summary}.

\subsection{Related Work}


\section{3-Dimensional Grid Drawings}

In this section, we present upper and lower bounds on $\crs_3(n,m)$.

\subsection{The Lower Bound}
\seclabel{3d-lower-bound}

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{3d-lower-bound}
  $\crs_3(n,m) \in \Omega((m^2/n)\log\log (m/n))$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be any geometric graph with $V(G)\subseteq\Z(X,Y,Z)$, with $XYZ\le
n$, $|E(G)|=m$, and for which $\crs_3(G,n)=\crs_3(n,m)$.  We may assume,
without loss of generality, that no edge of $G$ contains any point of the
$X\times Y\times Z$ grid in its interior; any such edge can be replaced
with a shorter edge without introducing any additional crossings.

For a prime number, $p$, define the $X\times Y\times Z$ \emph{$p$-grid}
as the set of points
\[
  \{(x/p,y/p,z/p): x\in\{1,\ldots,pX\},\, y\in\{1,\ldots,pY\},\,
  z\in\{1,\ldots,pZ\}\} \enspace .
\]
Observe that, for two distinct primes $p$ and $q$, the intersection
of the $p$-grid and the $q$-grid is exactly the $X\times Y\times Z$
grid. (This is because the only integers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the
equation $a/p = b/q$ have $a\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ and $b\equiv 0\pmod q$,
so $a/p$ and $b/q$ are each integers.)

Note that the number of points in the $X\times Y\times Z$ $p$-grid is
no more than $np^3$.  Note, furthermore, that each edge $uw$ of $G$
contains the $p$-grid points
\[
    P_{uw}^p = \{ (i/p)(u-w) : i\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\} \} \enspace .
\]
Next, we claim that $P_{uw}^p$ does not contain any $q$-grid points for
any prime $q\neq p$.  In fact, $P_{uw}^p$ does not contain any point of
the $X\times Y\times Z$ grid.  This follows from the assumption that
no edge contains a grid point in its interior, so $\gcd(\x(u)-\x(w),
\y(u)-\y(w), \z(u)-\z(w))=1$.  In particular, at least one of
$\x(u)-\x(w)$, $\y(u)-\y(w)$, $\z(u)-\z(w)$ does not have $p$ as a
divisor.  If, say, $\x(u)-\x(w)$ does not have $p$ as a divisor then
$i(\x(u)-\x(w))/p$ is not an integer and therefore $(i/p)(u-w)$ is not
on the $X\times Y\times Z$ grid.

Therefore, there are at least $(p-1)m$ incidences between edges of $G$ and
points of the $p$-grid that are not points of any $q$-grid for $q\neq p$.
Any point of the $p$ grid incident on $k$ edges contributes $\binom{k}{2}$
to $\crs_3(G)$.  Therefore, the total contribution of the $p$-grid to
$\crs_3(G)$ is at least
\[
    np^3\binom{m(p-1)/np^3}{2} \ge cm^2/np
\]
for $c<blah$ and $m(p-1)/np^3 \ge 2$.  This latter condition can be
rewritten as $p \le c'(m/n)^{1/2}$ for a sufficiently small $c'>0$.
Finally, we finish by summing over primes $p$ smaller than $c'p^{1/2}$:
\[
   \crs(G) \ge \sum_{p} cm^2/np = (cm^2/n) \sum_{p} 1/p = ((cm^2/n)(\ln\ln(m/n)-O(1))
\]
where the last inequality is Euler's result on the sums of reciprocals
of primes. (This sum is also known as a harmonic series of primes.  See,
e.g., Hardy and Wright \cite{hw79}.
\end{proof}

%\To see this, notice that 
%\begin{thm}
%  $g(n,m,q)=\Omega(m^3/q^2)$ 
%\end{thm}
%
%\begin{proof}
%The weaker inequality ,
%\begin{equation}
%  g(n,m,q)\ge m-7q \enspace ,\eqlabel{weak}
%\end{equation}  
%is easily shown by induction
%on $m$, using the result of Cyzowicz \etal\ \cite{X} which states that
%$g(n,m,q) > 0$ if $m> 7q$ (any drawing with more than $7q$ edges contains
%at least one crossing).
%
%Next we show that, using induction on $n$, that 
%\[
%   g(n,m,q) \ge Cm^3/q^2
%\]
%for any $m\ge 8q$.  Note that the case 
%
%
%First, note that the result is easily established
%using \eqref{weak} for any $m$ such that $8q\le m\le 9q$ for $C\le 1/81$.
%
%Next, consider the case $m> 9q$.  Consider some drawing, $\varphi$, of
%$G$ with $\crs(G,q)$ crossings.  Count the pairs $(c,w)$ where $c$ is
%a crossing and $w$ is a vertex not incident to either of the two edges
%involved in $c$.  Each crossing, $c$, appears in $n-4$ such pairs so
%the total number of those pairs is $(n-4)\crs(G,q)$.  On the other hand,
%each vertex, $w$, occurs in at least $\crs(G\setminus w,q)$ such pairs.
%Therefore,
%\[
%   (n-4)\crs(G,q) \ge \sum_{w\in V(G)} \crs(G\setminus w, q) \enspace .
%\]
%The number, $m_w$, of edges in $G\setminus w$ is at least $m-(n-1)
%\ge m-q\ge 8q$ so, by induction, $\crs(G\setminus w,q)\ge Cm_w^3/q^2$.
%Putting everything together, we have
%\begin{align*}
%  (n-4)\crs(G,q) 
%    & \ge  \sum_{w\in V(G)} \crs(G\setminus w, q) \\
%    & \ge  C\sum_{w\in V(G)} m_w^3/q^2  \\
%    & \ge  Cn((n-2)m/n)^3/q^2 & \left(\mbox{since $\sum_{w\in V(G)} m_w^3\ge n((n-2)m/n)^2$}\right) \\
%    & =  (Cm^3/q^2)\cdot(n(n-2)^3/n^3)  \\
%\end{align*}
%Damn! The second factor in the last line is less than 1 and I don't see any
%way to fix it.
%\end{proof}
%

\subsection{The Upper Bound}
\seclabel{3d-upper-bound}

In this section, we prove the following result:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{3d-upper-bound}
  $\crs_3(n,m) \in O((m^2/n)\log (m/n))$.
\end{thm}

The proof of \thmref{upper-bound} follows easily from the following lemma:
\begin{lem}\lemlabel{2-layer}
  There exists a drawing of the complete bipartite graph $K_{k^2,k^2}$
  on the $k\times k\times 2$ grid with $O(k^6\log k)$ crossings.
\end{lem}

Before proving the lemma, we first show how it implies
\thmref{upper-bound}: For simplicity, in what follows, assume $\sqrt{n}$,
$\sqrt{m/n}$, and $\sqrt{m}/n$ are each integers.  Apply \lemref{2-layer},
with $k=\sqrt{m/n}$ and tile the $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}\times 2$ grid
with $n/k^2$ copies of this drawing. The resulting geometric graph has
$2n$ vertices, $nk^4/k^2=m$ edges and
\[ O((n/k^2)k^6\log k) = O(nk^4\log k) = O((m^2/n)\log(m/n))
\] 
crossings, as required by \thmref{upper-bound}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \lemref{2-layer}]
The drawing of $K_{k^2,k^2}$ is the obvious one; each point with
$z$-coordinate 1 is connected by an edge to every point with
$z$-coordinate 2.  We shall denote the resulting geometric graph
by $G_{k^2}$.

We start by considering some edge $uw$ with $\z(u)=1$ and counting
the number of edges that intersect $uw$.  Let $\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_k$ be
the planes that contain $uw$ and at least one additional grid point.
Observe that each plane $\pi_j$ contains, and is uniquely determined by,
a line in the plane $z=1$ that passes through some point, $p_j$ of the
integer lattice $\N^2$ and such that $up_j$ does not contain any other
lattice points, i.e., $\gcd(\x(u)-\x(p_j),\y(u)-\y(p_j))=1$ (see \figref{planes}).
\begin{figure}
  \centering{\includegraphics{planes}}
  \caption{A plane $\pi_j$, defined by a point $p_j$, with $\skp(\pi_j)=2$. ($\z$-coordinates are exaggerated.)}
  \figlabel{planes}
\end{figure}
Define the \emph{skip} of $\pi_j$ as
\[
   \skp(\pi_j)=\max\{|\x(u)|-\x(p_j)|,|\y(u)-\y(p_j)|\} \enspace .
\]
Observe that, if $\skp(\pi_j)=r$, then $\pi_j$ contains at most $2k/r$
points other than $u$ and $w$ and therefore contains at most $(k/r)^2$
edges that cross $uw$.  Furthermore, the number of planes $\pi_j$ such
that $\skp(\pi_j)=r$ is at most $4r+1$.  Therefore, the total number
of edges that cross $uw$ is at most
\begin{equation}
   \sum_{r=1}^k (4r+1)(k/r)^2 \le 4k^2\ln k + O(k) \enspace . \eqlabel{critical}
\end{equation}
Since this is true for each of the $k^4$ edges, $uw$, we conclude that
the total number of crossings in this drawing of $K_{k^2,k^2}$ is at
most $4k^6\ln k+O(k^3)\in O(k^6\log k)$, as required.
\end{proof}

%We finish this section with a strengthening of \thmref{upper-bound}
%that will be used to prove a lower bound on the number of non-crossing
%graphs that can be drawn on the $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}\times 2$ grid.
%Let $G_n$ denote the drawing of the bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ on the
%$\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}\times 2$ grid, as described in the proof of
%\thmref{upper-bound}.
%Define the \emph{length} of an edge $uw$ in $G_n$ as
%\[
%   \len(uw) = \max\{|\x(u)-x(w)|, |y(u)-y(w)|\} \enspace .
%\]
%Note that this definition of length defines a partial order on the edges
%of $G_n$. Extend this to a total order by breaking ties arbitrarily so
%that for any two edges we can refer to the longer or the shorter of the
%two without ambiguity.  For any integer $M\in\{0,\ldots,n^2\}$,
%let $G_{n,M}$ denote the subgraph of $G_n$ that contains only the $M$
%shortest edges of $G_n$.
%
%\begin{lem}\lemlabel{gross-upper-bound}
%  Each edge of $G_{n,M}$ crosses at most $O((n/M)\log(n/M))$ other edges.
%\end{lem}
%
%\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
%The proof is a straightforward generalization of the proof of
%\lemref{2-layer}.  The number of edges in $G_n$ whose length is at
%most $r$ is $\Omega(nr^2)$.  Therefore, the longest edge in $G_{n,M}$
%has length $O(\sqrt{M/n})$.
%
%Observe that, if two crossing edges are contained in a plane $\pi_j$
%with $\skp(\pi_j)=r$, then at least one of the two edges has length at
%least $r$.  Therefore, when counting crossings in $G_{n,M}$,
% it is unnecessary to consider any plane $\pi_j$ with $\skp(\pi_j)>
% c\sqrt{M/n}$.  In this way the sum, \eqref{critical}, which counts the
% maximum number of edges intersecting any other edge, becomes
%\[
%   \sum_{r=1}^{c\sqrt{M/n}} (4r+1)(k/r)^2 \le 4c(M/n)\ln(M/n) + O(M/n)  \enspace .
%\qedhere
%\]
%\end{proof}

\section{Higher Dimensions}

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{4d-lower-bound}
  For all $m\ge 2(2^d-1)n$, $\crs_d(n,m)\in\Omega(m^2/n)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is similar to the simplified proof of the Crossing Lemma
  due to Chazelle, Sharir, and Welzl \cite{S}.  We begin by arguing that
  the preliminary inequality 
  \begin{equation}
    \crs_d(n,m) \ge m - (2^d-1)n  \eqlabel{prelim}
  \end{equation}
  holds for all $m \ge 0$.  To see this, recall that Czyzowicz \etal\
  \cite{s} showed that the maximum number of edges in a non-crossing
  drawing on a $d$-dimensional grid of volume $n$ is no more than
  $(2^d-1)n$.  Therefore, in any drawing of a graph with $m> (2^d-1)n$
  edges, we can always remove an edge that eliminates at least one
  crossing.  This can be repeated $m-(2^d-1)n$ times, which proves that
  the number of crossings is at least $m-(2^d-1)n$.

  Next, let $G$ be any graph with $m$ edges and consider the drawing
  of $G$ that attains $\crs_d(G)$.  Randomly sample each edge of $G$
  independently with probability $p$ to obtain a random subgraph $G'$
  of $G$.  The expected number of crossings in the resulting drawing of
  $G'$ is then
  \[  p^2\crs_d(G) \ge \E[\crs_d(G')] \ge pm - (2^d-1)n \enspace ,\] 
  where the second inequality follows from the preliminary bound
  in \eqref{prelim}.  Rewriting this, we obtain
  \[  \crs_d(G) \ge m/p - (2^d-1)n/p^2 \enspace . \]
  Setting $p=2(2^{d}-1)n/m$ yields
  \[  \crs_d(G) \ge \frac{m^2}{4(2^{d}-1)n} \enspace .  \qedhere \]
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}\thmlabel{4d-upper-bound}
  $\crs_d(n,m)\in O(m^2/n)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The proofs is like the proof of \thmref{3d-upper-bound}, but different.
\end{proof}

\section{The Number of Non-Crossing Graphs}

Next we show that the number of non-crossing geometric graphs that can
be drawn on the $n^{1/d}\times \cdots\times n^{1/d}\times 2$ grid is
at least $2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$.  

In this section, we show that, for dimensions $d\ge 4$, $\crs_d(n)\in
2^{\Theta(n\log n)}$, i.e., the maximum number of non-crossing graphs
that can be drawn on any grid of volume $n$ is $2^{\Theta(n\log n)}$.

The upper bound follows from the fact that any such graph drawn on
a grid of volume $n$ has at most $(2^d-1)n$ edges (Czyzowicz \etal\
\cite[Lemma Y]{X}); so any non-crossing graph corresponds to one of the
ways of choosing at most $(2^d-1)n$ edges from among the $\binom{n}{2}$
possible edges.  Therefore, the number of such graphs is at most
\[
    2^{(2^d-1)n}\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{(2^d-1)n} \le 2^{(2^d-1)n} (n^{2})^{(2^d-1)n} = 2^{2(2^d-1)n\log n+(2^d-1)n}
\]

We now prove a lower-bound of the same form:
\begin{thm}\thmlabel{4d-counting}
  $\ncs_d(n) \ge 2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
%For a geometric graph $G$, let $\ncs(G)$ denote the number of non-crossing
%subgraphs of $G$ and define
%\[
%   f(m,M) = \min\{ \ncs(G) : \mbox{$G$ is a subgraph of $G_{n,M}$ with $m$ edges} \}
%   \enspace . 
%\]
%Our goal is to lower-bound $f(n^2,n^2)$.  In order to do this, we first establish some preliminary recurrence inequalities and base cases.
%
%For our base cases, we have 
%\[ 
%   f(m,M)\ge 1 \enspace ,
%\]
%for all $m\in\{0,\ldots,cN\}$ since the subgraph of $G_{n,M}$ with no
%edges is non-crossing.
%
%Fix any geometric subgraph, $G$, of $G_{n,M}$ that has $m> cn$
%edges and select an edge $e$ from $G$. Then there are at least
%$f(m-1,M)$ subgraphs of $G$ that do not include $e$.  Furthermore, by
%\lemref{gross-upper-bound}, $e$ intersects at most $c(M/n)\log(M/n)$
%edges of $G$, so there are at least $f(m-c(M/n)\log(M/n),M)$ subgraphs
%of $G$ that include $e$.  Therefore,
%\[  f(m,M) \ge f(m-1,M) + f(m-c(M/n)\log(M/n)) \enspace ,
%\]
%for $m\ge c(M/n)\log(M/n)$.  Repeatedly expanding the first term gives:
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%f(m,M) & \ge & f(m-1,M) + f(m-c(M/n)\log(M/n), M) \\

%       & \vdots & \\
%       & \ge & (c(M/n)\log(M/n))\times f(m-2c(M/n)\log(M/n), M) \enspace ,
%\end{eqnarray*}
%for $m\ge 2c(M/n)\log(M/n)$.
%
%For an integer $t$, we can iterate the preceding $t$ times to obtain
%\begin{equation}
%   f(m,M) \ge (c(M/n)\log(M/n))^t\times f(m-2ct(M/n)\log(M/n), M)) \enspace ,
%   \eqlabel{recur-a}
%\end{equation} 
%for $m\ge 2ct(M/n)\log(M/n)$.
%
%Our next recurrence inequality is trivial: fix any subgraph, $G$,
%of $G_{n,M}$ and observe that the subgraph, $G\cap G_{n,M/2}$, of $G$
%that contains only the edges that appear in $G_{n,M/2}$ is a subgraph
%of $G_{n,M}$ and this subgraph contains at most $M/2$ fewer edges.  Thus
%\begin{equation}
%  f(m,M) \ge f(m-M/2,M/2) \enspace .
%  \eqlabel{recur-b}
%\end{equation}
%
%Our strategy is to prove that $f(n^2,n^2) \ge 2^{\Omega(n\log\log n)}$ by
%repeatedly applying \eqref{recur-a} and \eqref{recur-b}.  Each application of
%these inequalities gives reduced values of $m$ and $M$.  Let $m_i$ and $M_i$ be
%these values, respectively, after applying these inequalities $i$ times each.  Initially $m_0=M_0=n^2$.  After $i$ iterations, we will have $m_i=n^2/i2^i$ and $M_i=n^2/2^i$.  The first thing to understand is the decrease in the value of $m$ from one round to the next (slow and careful):
%\[
%    m_1 - m_0 = n^2/2
%\]
%and, for $i \ge 2$, 
%\begin{align*}
%  m_{i-1}-m_i
%      & = \frac{n^2}{(i-1)2^{i-1}} - \frac{n^2}{i2^{i}} \\
%      & = \frac{2n^2}{(i-1)2^{i}} - \frac{n^2}{i2^{i}} \\
%      & = \frac{2n^2}{(i-1)2^{i}} - \frac{n^2}{i2^{i}} \\
%      & = \frac{2in^2}{i(i-1)2^{i}} - \frac{(i-1)n^2}{i(i-1)2^{i}} \\
%      & = \frac{n^2(i+1)}{i(i-1)2^{i}} \\
%      & = n^2/i2^i + \Theta(n^2/i^22^i)\\
%\end{align*}
%The difference $m_i-m_{i-1}$ comes from two parts.  One part, $n^2/2^i$,
%comes from applying \eqref{recur-b}.  The second part,
%\[
%     n^2/i2^i 
%\]
%
\end{proof}


%\begin{proof}
%Consider the following the method of enumerating some of the subgraphs
%of $G_n$, which takes as input a subgraph, $G_{n,M}$, of $G_n$.
%We select an 
%
%
% that has $m$
%edges and which .  We select the longest edge
%
%
%We get the recurrence
%\[ f(m) \ge  
% \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $0< m < Cn$} \\
%               f(m-2) + f(m-c(m/n)\log(m/n)) & \text{otherwise} 
% \end{cases}
%\]
%If we focus on the second case, we can expand the first term
%$c(m/n)\log(m/n)$ times:
%\begin{align*}
%   f(m) & \ge f(m-2) + f(m-2c(m/n)\log(m/n)) \\
%        & \ge f(m-4) + 2f(m-2c(m/n)\log(m/n)) \\
%        & \ge f(m-6) + 3f(m-2c(m/n)\log(m/n)) \\
%        & \,\,\vdots \\
%        & \ge (cm/n)\log(m/n)\times f(m-2c(m/n)\log(m/n))
%\end{align*}
%By iterating this process $x=n/(2c\log(m/n))$ times, we obtain
%\[
%   f(m) \ge ((cm/n)\log(m/n))^x\times f(m/2)
%\]
%Next, notice that
%\begin{align*}
%((cm/n)\log(m/n))^x 
%   &= (c\log(m/n))^x2^{\log(m/n)x} \\
%   &= (c\log(m/n))^x2^{n/2c} \\
%   & \ge 2^{n/2c}
%\end{align*}
%for $m>n2^{1/c}$.  Thus far, we have
%\[
%   f(m) \ge 2^{n/2c}\times f(m/2) \enspace .
%\]
%We can now iterate this process $\alpha\log(m/n)$ times to obtain
%\[
%   f(m) \ge 2^{\alpha n\log(m/n)/2c}\times f(O(n)) 
%        \ge 2^{\alpha n\log(m/n)/2c} 
%        = 2^{\Omega(n\log n)}
%\]
%for $m=n^2$, as required.
%\end{proof}
%
%
%BLAAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH
%
%Now we prove, by induction on $m$ that 
%\[  \log(f(m)) \ge \alpha(m/n)\log(m/n) \]
%for some constant $\alpha > 0$.  The base cases occur when $m<cn$, in
%which case $\log(f(m))=1>\alpha c\log c$ for sufficiently small $\alpha$.
%For the inductive step, we have
%\begin{align}
%  \log(f(m)) 
%  & \ge \log(cm/2n)\log(m/n))+\log(f(m-(2cm/n)\log(m/n))) \\
%  & \ge \log(cm/2n)\log(m/n))+\alpha\left(\frac{m-\frac{2cm\log(m/n)}{n}}{n}\right)\log\left(\frac{m-\frac{2cm\log(m/n)}{n}}{n}\right) \\
%  & = \log(2cm/2n)\log(m/n))
%        +\alpha\left(\frac{m}{n} 
%                      - \frac{2cm\log(m/n)}{n^2}\right)
%        \log\left(\frac{m-\frac{2cm\log(m/n)}{n}}{n}\right) 
%\end{align}

\section{Summary}
\seclabel{summary}

We have given upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of crossings


The upper-bound $\crs_d(n,m)\in O(m^2/n)$ allows the application of
a recursive counting technique to show the lower-bound $\ncs_d(n)\ge
2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$; this is similar to way in which Ajtai \etal\ used
the lower-bound $\crs(n,m)\in\Omega(m^3/n^2)$ to show that that the maximum
number of planar graphs that can be drawn on any point set of size $n$
is $2^{O(n)}$.

In what appears to be a remarkable coincidence, neither the upper-bound
$\crs_3(n,m)\le O((m^2/n)\log (m/n))$ nor the lower-bound $\crs_3(n,m)\ge
\Omega((m^2/n)\log\log(m/n))$ is sufficiently strong to apply this
recursive counting technique to determine any non-trivial bound
on $\ncs_3(n)$.  If the upper-bound were slightly stronger, say
$\crs_3(n,m)\le O((m^2/n)\log^{1-\varepsilon}(m/n))$, then this would
be sufficient to prove that $\ncs_3(n)\ge 2^{\Omega(n\log^{\epsilon} n)}$.
