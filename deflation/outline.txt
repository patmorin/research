* Introduction
  -lots of research done in visibilities, including books (O'Rourke, Ghosh)
  -deformation problems posed by devadoss: convexification/deflation
   |specifics of subsequent work, including convexification result
  -in this paper we resolve the deflation problem
   |combinatorial structure capturing visibility properties of
    deflated polygons and relating them to non-deflated polygons
   |show that the equivalence relation on the set of deflated polygons
    induced by this combinatorial structure is equal to that induced
    by reachability through monotonic deformation

* Preliminaries
  Polygons and Visibility
  -polygon
   |triangulation
   |ear
  -visibility
   |vv-visibility
   |ve-visibility
   |see
   |facing
   |visibility graph
  -general position

 ** Deformation and Deflation
    -deformation
     |monotonic deformation
    -deflated polygon
     |deflated -> general position
     |triangulation and visibility graphs of deflated polygons
     |deflation

 ** Dual Trees
    -dual tree
    -right-reflex
     |reflex endpt
     |directed dual
    -superscript notation

* Consequences of Continuity (or Continuity Vertex-Edge Visibilities
    in Monotonic Deformation)
  !use arguments from calculus/analysis/continuity to prove facts
   about monotonic deformations.  cite abrego paper
  -safe neighbourhood lemmas
  -gp-ve-monotonicity of vv-monotonic deformations
  
* Deflated Polygons
  -visibility path
  -outer path
  -subpolygons are deflated
  -single polygon edge seen through a triangle-opposite edge of triangulation
   |induced edge sequences and their recursive nature
   |correspondence between induced sequences and visibility paths
  -visibility paths determine ve-visibilities
  -outer paths determine vv-visibilities

 ** Deflated Polygon Equivalence Relation
    -full characterization of deflated directed duals
    -if same dual, then monotonically deflatable into one another

* A Non-Deflatable Polygon
  -compatible directed dual
   |no compatible dual -> not deflatable
   |if there is a compatible directed dual, can be built from directed dual
  -exists a polygon that cannot be deflated
  -vv-visibilities do not determine deflatability

* Summary and Conclusion
  -summary (restate intro)
  -conjecture
   |possible avenue: prove that same ve-vis -> deform into each other
    w/o loss or gain of vv-visibility
   |stronger version (deflatable if exists a compatible directed dual)
