Reviewer A:
p.1, l.6/7: “The maximum number of planar graphs that can be em-
bedded on any fixed set of n points ...”. You probably mean “straight-
line embedded”, since so far you haven’t really defined graph, em-
bedding, etc. you should spell this out, since of course every planar
graph can be embedded on any point set with a sufficient number of
bends. Also, the Ajtai paper states their main result as “the number
of crossing-free subgraphs in a drawing of a graph with n vertices never
exceeds a fixed exponential of n”. Their drawings are not necessarily
straight-line. So what you claim as the main result is a consequence,
looking at the complete geometric graph on a given point set. Simi-
larly for the beginning of the fourth paragraph on this page. This may
be worth explaining in a bit more detail.

R Done.  We have restated their result as "The maximum number of non-crossing
subgraphs of any graph drawn on any fixed set of n points is 2^{O(n)}."

• p.1, l.-2: you define a geometric (grid) graph as a graph with vertex
set V (G) ⊆ N d . You seem to be explicitly assuming that by placing
the vertices in the lattice, the edges are automatically assumed to be
straight-line segments between the vertices; this needs to be explicitly
stated. 

R The edges of a geometric grid graph, like all graphs, are just pairs of
  vertices. However, in the same paragraph we point out that "we will use uw
  to refer both to the open line segment with endpoints u and w and to the
  edge uw ∈ E(G)"
  Later, the definitions of proper and non-crossing are all in terms of
  these segments.

Somewhat confusingly, you later (beginning of Section 1.3)
define the grid drawing of a graph which seems to be essentially the
same as a geometric grid graph: an (abstract) graph in which each
vertex is assigned to a point in a lattice (and in both definitions edges
are implicitly required to be line segments). What is the difference? I
think the terminology here differs a bit from standard terminology in
graph drawing, so it needs some clarification.

R Although the current paper contains only results about geometric grid
  graphs, the notion of grid drawings is necessary to describe related work.
  The difference between the two is that a grid drawing is a mapping of the
  vertices of some graph onto grid points.
  Most of this related work is about the minimum volume needed for
  non-crossing grid drawings of some class of not-necessarily-geometric graphs.

  Alternatively, we could define the grid drawings and then define geometric
  grid graphs as the graphs produced by these drawings.  This seems less
  appropriate though, since the main objects we study are grid graphs.

  We don't think that this is non-standard terminology in graph drawing.
  For example, Page 6 of the textbook [1] defines a drawing of a graph as
  "a function which maps each vertex v to a distinct point Tau(v) and maps
  each edge (u,v) to an open Jordan curve Tau(u,v)."  In our case, this 
  is simplified a little since Tau(u,v) is just the open line segment with 
  endpoint Tau(u) and Tau(v).

• p.2, l.11: The footnote states the different to the crossing number of a
graph, which is fair, but I think the comparison here would be to the
crossing number of the drawing of a graph, in which case the two def-
initions are very similar. 

R Done. We have added this comparison in the footnote.

And one point should maybe be emphasized
here: you are not counting the number of points at which crossings
occur (which would also be natural), but really the number of times a
crossing is formed by two edges; in particular, if k edges meet in the
same point, this accounts for k choose 2 crossings; this may be obvious, but
it’ll remove some ambiguity if it’s stated explicitly.

R Done.

• p.4, l. -5: “any such edge can be replaced with a shorter edge without
introducing any additional crossings”, this seemed obviously wrong
to me, and it is wrong if one tries to maintain the underlying ab-
stract graph G, what you’re not explicitly saying, and what would
have helped me when reading this, is that you are changing not just
the drawing of G but the underlying graph by adding a vertex and an
edge, and removing another edge. Please help the reader bit.

R. Done.  We have expanded this with "This modification may change the
   underlying graph, but does not change m or N , which are the only
   quantities considered in the statement of the theorem."

• p.6, l.-11: “and the essential p-grid points”: the fact that these points
are essential still needs a paragraph of argument which follows after-
wards; can you make it clearer at this point that it’s not obvious or
part of the definition of Q that these points are essential?

R Done.

• p.6, l.-5: the estimate on i=1 φ(i) is an upper bound, but what you
need in the following is a lower bound. If you look at the proof in
Hardy-Wright, it’s clear that (3/π 2 )n2 is a lower bound, so why not
just state (and use) it like that and drop all the O(n log n) terms.

R It was not clear to us that the Hardy-Wright proof gives a lower-bound
  of (3/pi^2)n^2.  At one point in the proof, it replaces an infinite
  sum with a finite sum and then subtracts O(n) to make up for this.
  Without delving deeper into the proof this means that, at best, it
  gives a lower bound of (3/pi^2)n^2-O(n).

  Reading this comment made us go back and review Hardy and Wright. As
  it turns out, with their definition of big-O notation, their Theorem~330
  is simultaneously an upper and a lower bound.  We now use this lower-bound.
  We have moved all this to the appendix, to address the next comment.

• p.6/7: the lower bound on n φ(i)2 /i3 is nice (even if the proof is a
i=1
bit messy, number theorists don’t have a more straightforward proof
of this?). In any case, it unnecessarily interrupts the flow of the main
proof at this point, can this be pulled out as a separate lemma (with
interest in its own right)?

R We were unable to find a statement of this result anywhere.  We have
  now moved it to the appendix, though.

• p.8, l.-10: instead of 2k/r it would be more informative to write “k/r
vertices on each of the two levels of G” or something like that.

R Done

• p.9, statement of Theorem 3: ‘In particular” is wrong (the relationship
goes the other way), maybe “More specifically, we have ...”? Or reverse
the two claims.

R Done

• p.11, l.13: “Therefore, any such graph corresponds ...”, awkward tran-
sition, since the “therefore” refers to the subordinate clause, and not
(as grammar would suggest), the main clause “The upper bound fol-
lows easily”.

R Done

• p.11, l. -3: in the definition of f (m) should it be “having at most
m edges”? Since you claim f (m) ≥ 1 because of the empty graph,
this seems to be necessary. 

R Actually, f(m)>= 1 because ncs(G)>=1 for all G.  We've moved this up to 
  make it clearer.

Also, this would seem to suggest that you
only consider subgraphs with the same vertex set as GN ? Otherwise,
f (m) ≥ 2N .

R We changed this to "let ncs(G) denote the number of crossing-free
subgraphs of G that have the same vertex set as G by with a subset of G’s edges"

• p.12, l.4/5: the logic here is a bit messy, first c is chosen so that cN
is an integer, and then something is argued for sufficiently large N ?
Really, c should be chosen first, according to Theorem 4, and then N
should be chosen so that cN is an integer, and, really, the remaining
argument has to be made for all such N to get the lower bound.

R Done. Now c=c(N) in O(1) is a function of N.

• p.12, l.7 and l.8: need “crossing-free subgraphs” not “subgraphs”.

R Done

• p.12, l.-13: instead of “for m ≥ 2ctN ” write “as long as m ≥ 2ctN ”,
clarifies the logic.

R Done

• p.13, l.8: the construction of Tm seems unnecessarily cumbersome,
why not simply take a spanning tree of the connected, spanning graphs
{uw, u, w, ∈ N (k, . . . , k, 2) : ud = wd = i and ||u − w|| = 1} for i = 1, 2
and combine with M ?

R The argument needs a spanning tree that contains all the edges of M. It's
  easy to produce a connected graph that includes all these edges. It's
  also easy to produce a spanning tree that includes some of these edges.

  This (also easy) argument just shows that one can start with a connected
  graph that includes all the edges of M and the repeatedly remove cycles
  by removing edges that are not in M.

In the formula defining the grid, there is an extra space before the dot.

R I believe the referee is refereeing to the \enspace before the period.
R This is standard when a display math environment finishes with punctuation.

``A d-D'' I quite don't like this notation. However, I see that it is the
one that generalizes the 2-D, 3-D... kind of notation. So, if you can think
of anything nicer, that would be appreciated, otherwise please ignore my
comment.

R We chose to stick with the d-D notation

``geometric (grid) graph, G, is'' Whenever you introduce the notation for a
graph or something, you introduce it between commas. I would prefer to see
it without commas, like ``geometric (grid) graph G is''. This happens a lot
of times throughout the paper.

R We chose to leave this as is.

The definitions of cr_d(N,m) and ncs_d(N) would rather have similar styles.
Besides, in the definition of ncs_d(N), I don't see why you split the
properties that G has to satisfy into two sets. Hence, ncs_d(N)=max{|G|: G
is a d-D geometric grid graph, cr(G)=0, and vol(G)\leq N}

R We have note changed this.  ncd_d(N) counts the number of crossing free
  graphs that can be drawn on any grid of volume N.  The formula given above
  counts the size of the graph.

There is a bit of a mess with the definition of essential p-grid. In
particular, ``Otherwise (p is composite), let p1,...,pk be the primes in the
prime factorization of p.'' Here you don't want the primes in the
factorization of p, but you want all the divisors of p (except for p
itself). Otherwise, the main property you want to ensure, that is, an
essential p-grid and an essential q-grid do not share points, would not be
true. E.g. the 8-grid and the 12-grid would both contain point (5/4,5/4,5/4)

R Done. We have made this changed and carefully gone over the remainder of
  the proof to ensure that every statement that follows is still true.

In the definition of P^p_{uw} you introduce the notation (w-u) that you
might want to define earlier.

R We chose not do this.  We already do addition of points and multiplication
  of points by a scalar.  We believe that this is clear (and standard) that
  we are simply treating the points as vectors and doing coordinate-wise
  addition (or subtraction in this case).

``Euler totient function \phi(p) = p \prod_{q|p}(1-1/q)''. This needs some
explanation. In particular, you should say explicitly that the product is
over all q that are primes in the factorization of p (and not over all
divisors, which seems to be the case from your writing).

R Done

``the total number of incidences between points of the essential p-grid and
edges of G is at least m \phi(p).'' Isn't this number exactly m \phi(p)?

R Yes, this following if we make use of the assumption that no edge contains
  a grid point.  However, the preceding discussion doesn't prove this. It
  only shows that Q^p_{uw} contains only points on the essential p-grid.
  It does not show that Q^p_{uw} contains all the essential p-grid points
  incident on uw.

one''

R Done

``Therefore, the total contribution of crossings'' Be more precise here on
what you mean. In this argument, I don't see where you exclude the R_i's
that are equal to 1 (those contribute to the incidences, but not to the
number of crossings): I believe there is no much difference in the final
calculation, but still that should be counted.

R We didn't exclude these R_i we because it is unecessary.  If R_1 = 1,
  then R_i choose 2 = R_i(R_i-1) / 2 = 1*0/2 = 0.

You write that a binomial coefficient is greater than or equal to
\Omega(something). I guess that should be an equal or even better an \in,
because of the switch to the asymptotic notation.

R Done


At some point (perhaps before Page 6) it would be nice to insert a sentence
saying that you are counting separately crossings happening on each
essential p-grid, for all possible values of p.

R We have addressed this earlier up by addressing the suggestion about
  why we define the essential p-grid to avoid double-counting.

There is a bit of imprecision in "each plane \pi_j contains, and is uniquely
determined by, a line in the plane {z \in R^3 : z_3 = 1}, that contains u
and some vertex, x" There might be in fact planes that contain a vertex of G
different from u and w and whose z-coordinate is equal to 2 and do not
contain any vertex of G different from u and w and whose z-coordinate is
equal to 1. (E.g., if w is close to (1,1,2) and u is close to
(\sqrt{N}/2,\sqrt{N}/2,1), there might be a point x close to
(\sqrt{N},\sqrt{N},2) such that the plane through w, u, and x contains no
other vertex of G whose z-coordinate is equal to 1). Maybe the easiest
solution to this issue is: Say that you only consider the planes that pass
through u, through w, and through the vertices of G whose z-coordinate is
equal to 1 and argue that any edge crossing uw lies in one of such planes.

``the midpoint (u+w)=2 of uw is contained in the X_1 x ... x X_d essential

I found quite curios that you attribute Open Problem 2 to Wood. Open Problem
2 is the natural problem left open by your paper. Therefore, either (1) Wood

research), or (2) Wood communicated the problem after you conducted this
research or while you were conducting this research (in this case I would
add that he *independently* raised this question, as I don't believe you
didn't think about the same question). Not an important issue altogether, it
is just weird the way you present this open problem.
