This section seems overly verbose in an otherwise easy to read paper. The two "unsuccessful" lower bounds aren't very informative, and considering that the actual lower bound is more of a "hand waving" argument, they seem redundant. Do you really need to formally present Shannon's theorem?

We have left these lower bounds in because we feel that they distinguish the problem from previous work on point-location in structures like triangulations.  For example, even with quadratic space, it would not be possible to match either of these entropy lower-bounds.
