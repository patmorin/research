  We show that, for any set $V$ of $n$ points, there exists a geometric
  graph with vertex set $V$, $O(n)$ edges, and that has average stretch
  factor $1+f(n)$, where $f(n)\in o_n(1)$.  This result holds, with
  differing values of $f(n)$, when $V$ is a planar point set, a set
  of points in $\R^d$, or the elements of a metric space with bounded

\section{Introduction}

The \emph{average stretch factor} of a geometric graph, $G$, with vertex
set $V(G)\subset \R^d$ and edge set $E(G)$ is
\[
    \asf(G) = \binom{|V(G)|}{2}^{-1}\sum_{\{u,w\}\in\binom{V(G)}{2}}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
\]
\ldots

\section{The Construction}

We make use of the following construct:  A \emph{$k$-partition} of a
set $V$ of $n$ points consists of a set, $D$,
of disks and an assignment $f:V\to D$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $|D|\in O(n/k)$,
  \item for each $u\in V$, $u\in f(u)$ (i.e., $u$ is a assigned to a
    disk that contains $u$),
  \item for each $\Delta\in D$, $|\{u\in V: f(u)=\Delta\}|\le k$ (i.e.,
   at most $k$ points are assigned to each disk),
  \item for every $r> 0$, $c\ge 2$, and $p\in\R^2$, the number of disks
   whose radius is in the range $[r,2r)$ and that contain $p$ is $O(1)$.
\end{enumerate}
For any set $V$ of $n$ points, a $k$-partition exists and can be found in
$O(n\log n)$ time. [Prove this---I think you get it from Michiel's trick
of separating the fair split tree into components of maximum size $k$.]
Note that, aside from Property~4, there is very little structure to
the disks in $D$. In particular, disks in $D$ may overlap and may
even contain each other.

\begin{thm}
  For every set, $V$, of $n<\infty$ points in $\R^2$, there
  exists a geometric graph $G$ with $V(G)=V$, $|E(G)|\in O(n)$ and
  $\asf(G)=1+o_n(1)$.  More precisely, $\asf(G)=1+O((\log n/n)^{1/4})$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  In the following proof, the variables $c,k\in\omega_n(1)$ and $\delta\in
  o_n(1)$ are used before they are specified.  Values of these variables
  that optimize the average spanning ratio are given at the end of
  the proof.

  We begin with a $k$-partition $(\{\Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_{n'}\},f)$
  of $V$, and we use the convention that $\Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_{n'}$
  are ordered by decreasing size.  For each $i\in \{1,\ldots,n'\}$,
  let $V_i=\{u\in V : f(u)=\Delta_i\}$; that is, $V_i$ is the set of
  points assigned to disk $\Delta_i$.  For each set $V_i$, we choose a
  representative vertex, $u_i$, and add edges joining $u_i$ to each other
  vertex in $V_i$ (see \figref{overview}). Let $N=\{u_1,\ldots,u_{n'}\}$
  denote the set of representative vertices and recall that $|N|=n'\in
  O(n/k)$.

  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center} 
      \includegraphics{overview}
    \end{center} 
    \caption{Using a $k$-partition, $G$ contains $O(n/k)$ stars whose
      centers are interconnected by a $(1+1/k)$-spanner}
    \figlabel{overview}
  \end{figure}

  Next, we add two spanner constructions to $G$.  The first is a
  $(1+1/k)$-spanner of $N$ and the second is a $2$-spanner of $V$.
  Thus, for any $u,w\in V$ we have
  \[
     \frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|} \le \begin{cases}
           1+1/k & \text{if $u,w\in N$} \\
           2 & \text{in any case.}
         \end{cases}
  \]
  
  Let $r_i$ denote the radius of $\Delta_i$ and let $D_i$ be a disk
  centered at the center of $\Delta_i$ and having radius $cr_i$.
  Points of $V$ that are in $D_i\setminus \Delta_i$ can be problematic
  for $V_i$; there is no guarantee that such points have a $1+o(1)$
  spanning path to the points in $V_i$.  The final step in the spanner
  construction attempts to deal with most of these problematic points.

  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,n'\}$, we find a disk, $E_i$, of radius
  $r_i/c$, with center in $D_i$, and that contains the maximum number
  of points of $V$.  (Note that this may include points of $V$ in $V_i$
  or outside of $D_i$.)  We then add edges joining each of the points
  in $V_i$ to some point in $E_i$.  See \figref{hitter}.

  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{hitter}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The disk $E_i$ captures as many points of $V$ as possible
     while still having center in $D_i$.}
    \figlabel{hitter}
  \end{figure}

  This concludes the description of the graph $G$.  In determining the
  average stretch factor of $G$, there are four types of pairs of points,
  $u\in V_i$, $w\in V_j$, $j\ge i$, to consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Pairs that are both from the same set; i.e., where $i=j$.  Each such
      pair has $\|uw\|_G/\|uw\|\le 2$ and each set $V_i$ contributes at
      most $\binom{k}{2}$ pairs to average, so their total contribution
      to the average is at most
      \[
        2\cdot\binom{n}{2}^{-1}\cdot\binom{k}{2}\cdot O(n/k) \in O(k/n)
        \enspace .
      \]
    \item Pairs for which $w$ is outside of $D_i$.  For each
      such pair, 
      \[
        \|uw\|_G/\|uw\|\le (1+1/k)(1+O(1/c)) \in O(1+1/k+1/c) \enspace .
      \]
    \item Pairs for which $w$ is contained in $E_i$.  For each
      such pair, 
      \[
        \|uw\|_G/\|uw\|\le 1+O(1/c) \enspace .
      \]
    \item Pairs for which $w$ is contained in $D_i'$.  For each
      such pair, $\|uw\|_G/\|uw\|\le 2$.  The number of such pairs is
      $\sum_{i=1}^{n'} |V\cap D_i'|$, so the total contribution of such
      pairs to the average stretch factor is at most
      \[
            2\cdot\binom{n}{2}^{-1}\cdot k\cdot\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n'} |V\cap D_i'|\right) \enspace .
      \]
  \end{enumerate}

%  As we will see, the only problematic points that remain for $V_i$
%  are those contained in $D_i'=D_i\setminus E_i$.  The average stretch
%  factor of $G$ can be expressed as
%  \begin{align*}
%    \asf(G) 
%      & = 
%      \binom n2^{-1}\left(
%        \sum_{i=1}^{n'}\sum_{u,w\in V_i}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}  
%         + \sum_{i=1}^{n'-1}\sum_{j={i+1}}^{n'}
%            \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%      \right)  \\
%      & \le 
%         \binom n2^{-1}\left(n'k^2 
%          + \sum_{i=1}^{n'-1}\sum_{j={i+1}}^{n'}
%           \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%      \right)  \\
%      & = 
%         O(k/n) + \binom n2^{-1}\left(  
%          \sum_{i=1}^{n'-1}\sum_{j={i+1}}^{n'}
%           \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%      \right)  \\
%   \end{align*}
%  Next, we fix a particular value of $i$ and focus on the sum
%  \begin{equation}
%       \sum_{j={i+1}}^{n'}
%          \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%          \eqlabel{blah}
%  \end{equation}
%  that appears above.  Partition the index set $\{i+1,\ldots,n'\}$ into
%  two sets $I_i$ and $I_i'$, where $I_i$ contains exactly the indices
%  $j$ such that $\Delta_j$ intersects $D_i$, so that $I_i$ indexes the
%  subsets of $V$ that are problematic for $V_i$ (see \figref{indexer}).
%  Then we have
%  \begin{figure}
%    \begin{center}
%      \includegraphics{indexer}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption{$I_i$ indexes the (red) sets that are problematic for $V_i$
%     while $I_i'$ indexes the (green) sets for which there is a $1+o(1)$
%     spanning path to the points in $V_i$.}
%    \figlabel{indexer}
%  \end{figure}
%  \begin{align*}
%     \eqref{blah} 
%      & = \sum_{j\in I_i}
%           \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%         + \sum_{j\in I_i'}
%           \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|} \\
%      & = \sum_{j\in I_i}
%          \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|} 
%         + \sum_{j\in I_i'} |V_i||V_j|(1+O(1/c+1/k)) \enspace .
%  \end{align*}
%  Putting these pieces back together, we have
%  \begin{align}
%     \asf(G) & \le O(k/n) + \binom{n}{2}^{-1}\left(
%       \sum_{i=1}^{n'}\left(\sum_{j\in I_i}
%          \sum_{u\in V_i}\sum_{w\in V_j}\frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|} 
%         + \sum_{j\in I_i'} |V_i||V_j|(1+O(1/c+1/k))\right)\right) \notag\\
%      & = O(k/n) +\binom{n}{2}^{-1}
%       \sum_{i=1}^{n'}\left(\sum_{j\in I_i}
%          \sum_{u\in V_i}\left(
%             \sum_{w\in V_j\cap D_i'}
%               \frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%             +\sum_{w\in V_j\cap D_i\setminus D_i'}
%               \frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%           \right)
%          + \sum_{j\in I_i'} |V_i||V_j|(1+O(1/c+1/k)) \right) \notag\\
%      & = O(k/n) +\binom{n}{2}^{-1}
%       \sum_{i=1}^{n'}\left(\sum_{j\in I_i}
%          \sum_{u\in V_i}\left(
%             \sum_{w\in V_j\cap D_i'}
%               \frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|}
%             +\sum_{w\in V_j\cap D_i\setminus D_i'}
%               (1+O(1/c))
%           \right)
%          + \sum_{j\in I_i'} |V_i||V_j|(1+O(1/c+1/k)) \right) \notag\\
%     & \le 1+O(k/n+1/c+1/k)) +\binom{n}{2}^{-1}
%       \sum_{i=1}^{n'}\sum_{j\in I_i}
%          \sum_{u\in V_i}
%             \sum_{w\in V_j\cap D_i'}
%               \frac{\|uw\|_G}{\|uw\|} \notag\\
%     & \le 1+O(k/n+1/c+1/k) +\binom{n}{2}^{-1}
%       \sum_{i=1}^{n'}\sum_{j\in I_i} 2 |V_i||V_j\cap D_i'| \notag\\
%     & \le 1+O(k/n+1/c+1/k) +\binom{n}{2}^{-1}
%       2k\sum_{i=1}^{n'}\sum_{j\in I_i} |V_j\cap D_i'| \eqlabel{huff} 
%     \enspace .
%  \end{align}
%  Thus, all that remains is to show that
%  $\sum_{i=1}^{n'}\sum_{j\in I_i} |V_j\cap D_i'| \in o(n^2/k)$.
%  Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that this is not the case
%  and that

  The total number of pairs of Type~2 and 3 is at most $\binom{n}{2}$,
  thus the total contribution of these pairs to the average spanning ratio
  is at most
  \[
    \binom{n}{2}^{-1}\cdot\binom{n}{2}\cdot(1+O(1/k+1/c)) = 1+O(1/k+1/c) \enspace .
  \]
  Thus, all that remains is to show that $\sum_{i=1}^{n'}|V\cap D_i'|
  \in o(n^2/k)$.  Suppose, for the sake of contradiction,
  that this is not the case and that
  \begin{equation}
    \epsilon n^2/k \le \sum_{i=1}^{n'} |V\cap D_i'| 
         \enspace . \eqlabel{kicker}
  \end{equation}
  The right hand side of \eqref{kicker} has $n'\le \alpha n/k$
  terms, for some constant $\alpha >0$ and each of these terms
  is at most $n$.  Therefore, there must exist at least
  $(\epsilon/\alpha)n/k$ values of $i$ such that $|V\cap D_i'|\ge
  (\epsilon/\alpha)n$.  In particular, there exists a point $u\in V$
  and indices $i_1,\ldots,i_\ell$ such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item $u\in V\cap D_{i_j}'$ for all $j\in\{1,\ldots,\ell\}$,
     \item $|V\cap D_{i_j}'|\ge \delta n$ for $\delta\in\Theta(\epsilon)$
       and all $j\in\{1,\ldots,\ell\}$, and
     \item $\ell\in\Omega(n/k)$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Suppose, without loss of generality, that the smallest disk
  in $D_{i_1},\ldots,D_{i_\ell}$ has unit radius.  Partition
  $i_1\ldots,i_\ell$ into groups $G_0,G_1,\ldots$ such that $G_t$
  contains all indices $i_j$ such that $D_{i_j}$ has radius in the
  interval $[2^t,2^{t+1})$.
  We claim that each such group, $G_t$, has size $O(c^2)$.  To see
  why this is so, observe that, for each group $G_t$, there exists a
  point $u\in V$ that is contained in $\Omega(|G_t|)$ regions $D_{i}'$
  where $i\in G_t$.  $D_{i}'$ has radius at most $c2^{t+1}$.  This means
  that the set of disks
  \[
     \{ \Delta_i : i\in G_t\}
  \]
  is contained in a disk, centered at $u$, of radius at most
  $(c+1)2^{t+1}$.  Since each disk in this set has radius in
  $[2^t,2^{t+1})$, Property~4 of $k$-partitions ensures that the size
  of $G_t$ is $O(c^2)$.

  Thus far, we have shown that each group, $G_t$, has size $O(c^2)$
  and the total size of all groups is $\Omega(n/k)$.
  Therefore, there must be at least $\Omega(n/(kc^2))$ groups.
  In particular, we can find $h\in\Omega(n/(kc^2\log c))$ groups,
  $G_{t_1},\ldots,G_{t_h}$, such that $t_{i+1} \ge
  t_{i}+2\log c+2$.  By selecting a representative element from each
  of these groups, we obtain a sequence of indices $i_1,\ldots,i_h$
  such that the radius of $\Delta_{i_{j+1}}$ is at least $4c^2$ times the
  radius of $\Delta_{i_j}$ for each $j\in\{1,\ldots,h-1\}$.

  By choice, $D_{i_1}'$ contains at least $\delta n$ elements of $V$
  including the point $u$.  Also by choice, $D_{i_2}'$ contains at least
  $\delta n$ elements of $V$, including $u$.  We claim that $E_{i_2}$
  contains at least $\delta n$ elements of $V$ as well since there
  exists a disk, $E_{i_2}'$, centered at $u$, of radius $r_{i_2}/c >
  4cr_{i_1}$, that contains $D_{i_1}$ and therefore contains all the
  (at least $\delta n$) points in $D_{i_1}'$ (see \figref{containment}).
  The disk $E_{i_2}$ is chosen to contain as many elements of $V$ as
  possible, so it contains at least as many elements as $E_{i_2}'$.
  Therefore, $D_{i_2}'\cup E_{i_2}$ contains at least $2\delta n$
  points of $V$.

  \begin{figure}
     \begin{center}
       \includegraphics{containment}
     \end{center}
     \caption{$D_{i_2}\cup E_{i_2}$ contains at least $2\delta n$ 
              points of $V$.}
     \figlabel{containment}
   \end{figure}

  We can now argue similarly to show that $E_{i_3}$ contains at least
  $2\delta n$ points of $V$ so $D_{i_3}'\cup E_{i_3}$ contains at least
  $3\delta n$ points of $V$.  In general, this argument shows that
  $D_{i_h}\cup E_{i_h}$ contains at least $h\delta n$ points of $V$.
  But this yields a contradiction for $h> 1/\delta$, since $V$
  contains only $n$ points.  This condition is satisified for $\epsilon > 1/h \in O(kc^2\log c/n)$. We conclude that 
  \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n'}|V\cap D_i'| 
       \le \epsilon n^2/k  \in O(nc^2\log c)
  \]
  so the total contribution of Type~4 pairs to the average stretch factor
  is at most
  \[
    2\cdot\binom{n}{2}^{-1}\cdot k\cdot O(nkc^2\log c) \in O(kc^2\log c/n) \enspace .
  \]
  Putting all four cases together, we obtain
  \[
     \asf(G) = 1 + O(k/n + 1/k + 1/c + kc^2\log c/n) \enspace .
  \]
  Taking $c=k=(n/\log n)^{1/4}$ and $\epsilon = \gamma (\log n/n)^{1/4}$,
  for a sufficiently large constant $\gamma >0$ gives $\asf(G)=1+O((\log
  n/n)^{1/4})$.
\end{proof}

[Here we should discuss what's needed to make this work in $\R^d$ and in
metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension.]
