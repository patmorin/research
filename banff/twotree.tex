\section{Introduction}

We prove a theorem about representing 2-trees as subgraphs of rectangle
intersection graphs. This theorem implies that, for any $k\in\N$, there
exists a 2-tree, $T_k$, such that any rectangle intersection graph that
contains a subgraph isomorphic to $T_k$ contains a $k$-clique.

\section{Preliminaries}

We define some geometric terminology and a particular graph.

\subsection{Rectangles}

Throughout this paper, the word \emph{rectangle} means open axis-aligned
rectangle: a subset of $\R^2$ of the form $(x_1,x_2)\times (y_1,y_2)$,
where $x_1<x_2$ and $y_1<y_2$.  The rectangle $R$ has four \emph{corners}
$(x_i,y_j)$ for each $i,j\in\{1,2\}$ and it has four \emph{sides}: closed
vertical or horizontal line segments whose endpoints are corners.  We call
these the left, top, right, and bottom sides of $R$ in the obvious way.
A \emph{rectangle intersection graph} is a graph whose vertices are
rectangles and the edge between two rectangles $u$ and $w$ is present
if and only $u\cap w\neq \emptyset$.

We will make use of the fact that the set of rectangles in the plane is
a Helly family (of order 2) \cite[Chapter~11]{bollobas:combinatorics}:
\begin{obs}\obslabel{helly}
   If $u$, $v$, and $w$ are rectangles that pairwise intersect, then
   $u\cap v\cap w\neq\emptyset$.
\end{obs}
\obsref{helly} follows from Helly's Theorem for real intervals
and the observation that a rectangle is the Cartesian product of
two real intervals (see \cite[Page~83]{bollobas:combinatorics} or
\cite{bollobas.duchet:helly}).

Let $v$ and $w$ be two rectangles with $R=v\cap w\neq \emptyset$ and
such that $w$ does not contain any corner of $v$.  We say that $(v,w)$
is an \emph{h-pair} if the left or right side of $R$ is contained in
$\partial v$.  We say that $(v,w)$ is a \emph{v-pair} if the top or bottom
side of $R$ is contained in $\partial(v)$.  If $(v,w)$ is not an h-pair
or a v-pair, then we call it an \emph{o-pair}.  Note that, since $w$
does not contain a corner of $v$, $(v,w)$ is exactly one of a v-pair,
an h-pair or an o-pair. See \figref{hvo}.

   v-pairs & h-pairs & o-pair
   \end{tabular}
   \caption{Examples of v-pairs, h-pairs, and an o-pair.}
   \figlabel{hvo}
\end{figure}

Our proof works by finding a path in a rectangle intersection graph $G$
that defines a sequence of rectangles having properties that ensure
that these rectangles form a clique. See \figref{good-sequence} for an
illustration of the following definition:

\begin{dfn}\dfnlabel{hvo-alternating}
Let $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ be a sequence of rectangles and let
$R_i=\bigcap_{j=1}^i v_j$.  We say that $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ is
\emph{hvo-alternating} if
\begin{compactenum}
  \item for each $i\in\{2,\ldots,k\}$, $v_i\cap R_{i-1}\neq \emptyset$;
  \item for each $i\in\{2,\ldots,k\}$,
        $v_i$ does not contain any corner of $R_{i-1}$; and
  \item for each $i\in\{2,\ldots,k-1\}$, $(R_{i-1},v_i)$ and
        $(R_i,v_{i+1})$ are not both h-pairs and not both v-pairs.
\end{compactenum}
\end{dfn}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figs/good-sequence}
  \end{center}
  \caption{An hvo-alternating sequence of rectangles.}
  \figlabel{good-sequence}
\end{figure}

Note that Property~1 in \dfnref{hvo-alternating}, with $i=k$ ensures that
$\bigcap_{j=1}^k v_i\neq\emptyset$.  Therefore, if $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ are
vertices in a rectangle intersection graph $G$, then these vertices form a
$k$-clique in $G$.  Our proof attempts to grow an hvo-alternating sequence
of vertices in $G$. The following lemma shows that an hvo-alternating
sequence is neatly summarized by its last two elements:

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{hvo-alternating}
  If $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ is an hvo-alternating sequence of
  rectangles then $\bigcap_{i=1}^{k} v_i = v_{k-1}\cap v_k$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  The case $k=2$ is trivial, so we first consider the case $k=3$.
  Recall that, for any two sets $A$ and $B$, $A\supseteq B$ if and only
  if $A\cap B = B$. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that $v_1\supseteq
  v_2\cap v_3$.

  If $(v_1,v_2)$ is an o-pair, then $v_1\supseteq v_2\supseteq v_2\cap
  v_3$ and we are done.  Otherwise, assume without loss of generality
  that $(R_1,v_2)=(v_1,v_2)$ is an h-pair, so that $(R_2,v_3)$ is not an
  h-pair. Refer to \figref{geometric}.  In this case, $v_2\cap v_3$ is
  contained in the rectangle $R^*$ whose top and bottom sides coincide
  with those of $v_2$ and whose left and right sides coincide with
  those of $v_1$. We finish by Observing that $v_1\supseteq R^*\supseteq
  v_2\cap v_3$, as required.

  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{figs/geometric}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The proof of \lemref{hvo-alternating}.}
    \figlabel{geometric}
  \end{figure}

  Next consider the general case $k> 3$.
  By \dfnref{hvo-alternating}, the three element sequence
  $R_{k-2},v_{k-1},v_k$ is an hvo-alternating sequence so, applying 
  the result for $k=3$, we obtain
  \[  
   \bigcap_{j=1}^k v_j = R_{k-2}\cap v_{k-1}\cap v_k = v_{k-1}\cap v_k
   \enspace .  \qedhere 
  \]
\end{proof}

Sometimes the process of growing our hvo-alternating sequence stalls. The
following lemma shows that, when this process stalls, we can at least
replace the last element in the sequence.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{replacement}
  Let $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ be an hvo-alternating sequence of rectangles and
  define $R_i=\bigcap_{j=1}^i v_i$. Let $v$ be a rectangle such
  that 
  \begin{compactenum}
     \item $v\cap R_k\ne \emptyset$; 
     \item $v$ contains no corner of $R_k$; and 
     \item $v_1,\ldots,v_k,v$ is not hvo-alternating.
  \end{compactenum}
  Then $v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1},v$ is hvo-alternating.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Notice that $v_1,\ldots,v_k,v$ satisfies all the conditions to be
  hvo-alternating except that both $(R_{k-1},v_k)$ and $(R_k,v)$
  are both h-pairs or both v-pairs.  Without loss of generality assume
  that they are both h-pairs.

  It is sufficient to show that $(R_{k-1},v)$ is not a v-pair so that,
  by replacing $v_k$ with $v$ we are replacing the h-pair $(R_{k-1},v_k)$
  with a new with an h-pair or an o-pair.  But this is immediate, since
  $v$ intersects $R_k$ but does not intersect the top or bottom side
  of $R_k$.  Therefore $v$ cannot intersect the top or bottom side of
  $R_{k-1}\supseteq R_k$, so $(R_{k-1},v)$ is not a v-pair.
\end{proof}

If our process repeatedly stalls, then the hvo-alternating sequence we
are growing never gets any longer; we only repeatedly change the last
element in the sequence. Next we describe the sequences of rectangles
that appear during these repeated stalls and show that such sequences
(if long enough) also determine large cliques in $G$.

A sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ of rectangles is \emph{h-nesting} with
respect to a rectangle $R$ if, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, $(R,v_i)$
is an h-pair and, for each $i\in\{2,\ldots,k\}$, $(R\cap v_{i-1},v_i)$
is an h-pair.  See \figref{nesting}.  A \emph{v-nesting sequence} is
defined similarly by replacing h-pair with v-pair.

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figs/nesting}
 \end{center}
 \caption{Rectangles $v_1,\ldots,v_4$ that are h-nesting with respect to $R$.}
 \figlabel{nesting}
\end{figure}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{nesting}
   If $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ is an h-nesting sequence or a v-nesting sequence
   with respect to $R$, then there exists a point $x\in R$ such that $|\{
   i: x\in v_i \}|\ge \lceil k/2\rceil$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
   Assume, without loss of generality, that $v_1,\ldots,v_k$
   is an h-nesting sequence with respect to $R$.  Consider the
   sequence of horizontal strips $s_1,\ldots,s_k$, where each
   $s_i=(-\infty,\infty)\times (y_{i,1},y_{i,2})$ has top and
   bottom sides that coincide with those of $v_i$. Since, for each
   $i\in\{2,\ldots,k\}$, $(R,v_{i-1})$ and $(R\cap v_{i-1},v_i)$
   are both h-pairs, $s_1\supseteq s_2\supseteq\cdots\supseteq s_k$.
   Let $\ell$ be a point on the left side of $R$ contained in $s_k$
   and let $r$ be a point on the right side of $R$ contained in $s_k$.
   Since $(R,v_i)$ is an h-pair, $v_i$ contains at least one of $\ell$
   or $r$, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$.  Therefore, at least one of
   $\ell$ or $r$ is contained in at least $\lceil k/2\rceil$ rectangles
   in $v_1,\ldots,v_k$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{The Universal 2-Tree}

The \emph{height-$h$ $d$-branching universal 2-tree}, $T_{h,d}$ is
defined recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $T_{0,d}$ is a two-vertex graph with a single edge;
  \item For $h\ge 1$, $T_{h,d}$ is obtained from $T_{h-1,d}$ by adding,
     for each edge $vw \in E(T_{h-1,d})\setminus E(T_{h-2,d})$, $d$
     new vertices $x_{1,vw},\ldots,v_{d,vw}$ each adjacent to both $v$
     and $w$.
\end{itemize}
The \emph{root edge} of $T_{h,d}$ is the single edge of $T_{0,d}$.
For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,h\}$, the level-$i$ vertices of $T_{h,d}$
are the vertices in $V(T_{i,d})\setminus V(T_{i-1,d})$.  The level-$i$
edges of $T$ are the edges that join a level $i$ vertex to a level-$j$
for some $j<i$.

Note that the number of level-$i$ edges in $T_{h,d}$ is given by the recurrence
\[
   m_i = \begin{cases}
           1 & \text{if $i=0$} \\
           2dm_{i-1} & \text{otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\]
which resolves to $(2d)^{i}$.  Thus, the total number of edges in
$T_{h,d}$ is less than $(2d)^{h+1}$.

\section{The Result}

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{path-times-path}
  For each $k\in \N$, any rectangle intersection graph that contains
  $T_{4k-7,\iters}$ as a subgraph contains a clique of size $k$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  The cases $k=1$ and $k=2$ are trivial so, for the remainder of the proof
  we assume that $k\ge 2$.

  Let $G$ be a rectangle intersection graph that contains
  $T=T_{4k-7,\iters}$ as a subgraph.  We use the convention that
  $V(G)=V(T)$ so that vertices of $T$ are rectangles in $V(G)$.  
%  If
%  vertices $v$ and $w$ are adjacent in $T$, then $v\cap w \neq\emptyset$.
  We will attempt to define a path $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ in $T$ such that
  $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ is hvo-alternating. 
%  Since every hvo-alternating
%  sequence has  non-empty intersection, this implies that $v_1,\ldots,v_k$
%  form a clique in $G$.  The only cases in which we are unable to complete
%  this path occur because some point $x\in\R^2$ is contained in a set $X$
%  of $k$ vertices of $T$.  In these cases, the set $X$ forms a $k$-clique
%  in $G$.

  Let $vw$ be the root edge of $T$. We set $v_1=v$ and use the convention
  that $v_0=w$.  We will perform $\iters$ iterations, each of which
  tries to add another vertex, $v_{i+1}$, to a partially constructed
  hvo-alternating path $v_1,\ldots,v_i$. During iteration $t$, for
  each $t\in\{1,\ldots,\iters\}$, the procedure will consider a
  level-$t$ vertex, $v$, of $T$ to include in the path.  At the end of
  iteration $t$, the last vertex in the partially constructed sequence
  is always $v$, a level-$t$ vertex.

  At the beginning of iteration $t$, $v_i$ is a level-$(t-1)$ vertex, so
  $v_{i-1}$ and $v_i$ are both adjacent to a set $S$ of $4k-7$ level-$t$
  vertices.  Each of the rectangles in $S$ intersects $v_{i-1}$ and
  $v_i$ so, by \obsref{helly}, each rectangle in $S$ intersects
  $v_{i-1}\cap v_i$.  Therefore, by by \lemref{hvo-alternating}, each of
  the rectangles in $S$ intersects $R_i=\bigcap_{j=1}^i v_j$.

  If each rectangle in $S$ contains a
  at least one corner of $R_i$, then some corner of $R_i$ is contained 
  in at least
  \[
         \left\lceil(4k-7)/4\right\rceil = k-1
  \]
  rectangles.  Since these rectangles are open, there is a point $x$
  contained in these $k-1$ rectangles and in $v_{i}$.  The resulting set
  of $k$ rectangles therefore form a $k$-clique in $G$ and we are done.

  Otherwise, some rectangle $v\in S$ does not contain a corner of $R_i$.
  Notice that the sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_i,v$ is hvo-alternating except,
  possibly, that the pairs $(R_{i-1},v_i)$ and $(R_i,v)$ are both h-pairs
  or both v-pairs.  There are two cases to consider:
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item $v_1,\ldots,v_i,v$ is hvo-alternating. In this
       case we say that the procedure \emph{succeeds} in iteration $t$
       and we set $v_{i+1}=v$.

     \item $v_1,\ldots,v_i,v$ is not hvo-alternating.  In this case,
       we say that the procedure \emph{stalls} in iteration $t$.
       In this case, we \emph{change} $v_i$ by setting $v_i=v$. By
       \lemref{replacement} the resulting sequence is hvo-alternating,

       Note that in this case we have failed to make our path any
       longer. Instead, we have only replaced the last element with a
       level-$t$ vertex.  Regardless, the next iteration will try to
       extend the path with the new value of $v_i$.
  \end{enumerate}
  If we allow this procedure to run sufficiently long, then one of two
  cases occurs:
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item At least $k-1$ iterations are successes.
     In this case, we find $v_2,\ldots,v_k$, so that $v_1,\ldots,v_k$
     is an hvo-sequence whose vertices form a $k$-clique in $G$.

     \item Some element of our sequence,
     $v_i$ takes on a sequence $S_i=v_{i,0},\ldots,v_{i,2(k-i)}$
     of $2(k-i)+1$ different values because the procedure stalls
     $2(k-i)$ times while trying to select $v_{i+1}$.  In this
     case, $S_i$ is either h-nesting or v-nesting with respect
     to $R_{i-1}$ so, by \lemref{nesting}, all the rectangles in
     $S_i$ have a point in common with $R_{i-1}$.  But $R_{i-1}$
     is the common intersection of $v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1}$.  Therefore
     $v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1},v_{i,0},\ldots,v_{i,k-i}$ all have a point in
     common and form a $k$-clique in $G$.
  \end{enumerate}
  The number of iterations required before this procedure finds
  a $k$-clique in $G$ is at most
  \[
      h = \sum_{i=2}^k (2(k-i)+1) = k + (k-2)(k+1) = k^2-2 \enspace .
  \]
  During these $h$ iterations, the procedure selects a level-$j$ vertex
  of $T$ for $j=1,2,\ldots,h$.  Since $T$ has height $k^2-2 = h$, the 
  procedure succeeds in finding a $k$-clique before running out of levels.
\end{proof}

\section{Discussion}

The problem we consider in this paper comes from trying to understand
which graphs have a decomposition into two path partitions whose bags
have bounded intersections.  This turns out to be equivalent to the
more geometric problem of understanding which graphs are subgraphs of
rectangle intersection graphs of bounded clique size.  There are several
other ways we could generalize these problems.

The graph $T_{4k-7,2k^2}$ in \thmref{path-times-path} is a 2-tree.
On the other hand, any tree can be represented in an obvious way as a
rectangle intersection graph.  Between trees and 2-trees is the class
of outerplanar graphs:

\begin{op}
  Is there an integer $k$ such that, for every outerplanar graph $T$, there
  exists a rectangle intersection graph $G$ that contains $T$ as a subgraph
  but does not contain any $k$-clique?
\end{op}

Does adding extra dimensions help?  A $d$-D box intersection graph is
a graph whose vertices are $d$-dimensional axis-aligned boxes and for
which two vertices are adjacent if and only if they intersect.

\begin{op}
   For each $d\in\N$, what is the smallest value of $r=r_d$ for which this
   statement is true: For every $k\in\N$ there exists an $r$-tree $T$
   such that every $d$-D box intersection graph $G$ that contains $T$
   as a subgraph contains a $k$-clique?
\end{op}

\thmref{path-times-path} shows that $r_2 \le 2$, and the obvious
representation of trees (1-trees) as rectangle intersection graphs shows
that $r_2> 1$, so $r_2=2$.

For $d>2$, we can show that $r_d \le 2d$ using a universal $2d$-tree along
with the fact that, for any set $B$ of axis-aligned boxes, there exists
$B'\subset B$, $|B'|\le 2d$ such that $\bigcap_{b\in B}b=\bigcap_{b\in
B'}b$.  The only lower-bound we know is $r_d> 1$ that comes from drawing
trees as rectangle intersection graphs.  We conjecture the lower-bound
is tight:

\begin{conj}
   For every $d,k\in\N$, there exists a 2-tree $T=T(k,d)$ such that
   every $d$-D box intersection graph that contains $T$ as a subgraph
   contains a $k$-clique.
\end{conj}

Coming back to two dimension, if we let $C$ be a set of lines, we
can consider intersection graphs of \emph{$C$-oriented convex shapes}:
convex bodies whose boundaries consist of linear pieces, each of which is
parallel to some line in $C$.  (Axis-aligned rectangles are $C$-oriented
where $C$ is the set consisting of the x-axis and y-axis.)  For a set $C$
of lines, let $\mathcal{G}_C$ denote the class of intersection graphs
of $C$-oriented convex shapes.  For an integer $c$, let $\mathcal{G}_c=\bigcup_{C:|C|=c}\mathcal{G}_C$.

\begin{op}
   For each $c\in N$, what is the smallest value of $r=r_c$ such that the
   following statement is true: For every $k\in\N$, there exists an
   $r$-tree $T$ such that every graph $G\in\mathcal{G}_c$ that contains
   $T$ as a subgraph contains a $k$-clique?
\end{op}

Again, we can use the fact that, for any set $B$ of $C$-oriented convex
shapes, we can find a subset $B'\subset B$, $|B'|\le 2|C|$ to establish
that $r_c \le 2c$.  We do not know a lower bound better than $r_c > 1$.
