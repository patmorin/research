\section{Introduction}

We denote
by $e_i$ the unit vector parallel to the $i$th coordinate axis in the
positive direction.
For a non-zero vector $u$ and a point $p$ we denote by $H_u(p)$ the
closed halfspace with $p$ on its boundary and having inner normal $u$.
For any measure $\mu:2^{\R^d}\mapsto\R$ and any $1/2\le\tau < 1$,
the \emph{\taudepth} of $p\in\R^d$ with respect to $\mu$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    \tdepth(p,\mu) = \min\{ \tau \times \mu(H_u(p)\cap H_{e_1}(p)) 
           + (1-\tau)\times \mu(H_u(p)\cap H_{-e_1}(p)): \|u\|=1\} \enspace .
    \eqlabel{taudepth}
\end{equation}
For the special case $\tau=1/2$, \eqref{taudepth} simplifies to
\[
    \tukdepth(p,S) = \frac{1}{2}\min\{ \mu(H_u(p)) : \|u\|=1\} \enspace .
    \eqlabel{tukdepth}
\]
and multiplying by 2 yields the well-known \emph{halfspace depth}.
Often, we are concerned with the depth of a finite set
$S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ of points.  In such cases we use the measure
$\mu(X)=|X\cap S|$.

\Taudepth\ is a generalization of halfspace depth in which mass to the
right of $p$ is assigned more weight than mass to the left of $p$.
However, \taudepth\ is not simply a weighted version of Tukey depth as
the weight of a mass varies depending on the first coordinate of the
point $p$ being considered.  Indeed, while the halfspace depth
contours are convex, the same is not true, in general, of the
\taudepth\ contours (see \figref{example}).

white region has depth $1/4$, the gray region has depth $1/2$, and the
black region has depth $3/4$.}

\section{The Algorithm}

In order to leverage the existing work that has been done on efficient
algorithms for halfspace depth, we study the relationship between
halfspace depth and \taudepth.  For any real number $x$, define the
derived measure $\mu_x$ as
\[
           \mu_x(X) = \tau\times \mu(X\cap H_{e_1}(xe_1)) 
               + (1-\tau)\times \mu(X\cap H_{-e_1}(xe_1)) \enspace .
