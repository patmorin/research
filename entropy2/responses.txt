page 2, Equation 1: "... = H(G,D) = ..."
D has not been defined yet.

:  Fixed. D is defined sooner.

page 4, middle: "In particular, every geodesic triangle t consists of
a pseudotriangle \hat{t} and three paths joining the three convex
vertices of \hat{t} to a, b, and c." Please provide reference.

:  Done.  We have added a reference to a section of a survey by Rote,
:  Santos, and Streinu.

page 4, line -4: "... the closure of r(\ell) is a convex polygon."
Don't think r(\ell) has been defined yet.

:  Done. We have moved the definition of r(\ell) up in the text.

page 6, Section 3: Before delving into the technical details of the
construction of the minimum entropy triangulation, it would be nice if
you could give a high-level overview/intuition of your strategy.

:  Done. We have added two paragraphs outlining our construction algorithm
:  and comparing it to the top-down construction of a near-optimal binary
:  search tree.
  
page 6, last para: "To do this, we first partition \hat{t} ... as
shown in Figure 2.1."
Sounds a bit awkward. Please see if there's a better way of saying
this than do this step as shown in the figure.

:  Done.  We have added a paragraph describing how to perform this
:  partitioning.
  

page 7, footnote: "The existence of such an edge e_i is assured by yet
another continuity argument."
I have some doubts about whether e_i indeed exists with the desired
property. Please make sure there is no bug here; add explanation/proof
as necessary.

:  An argument and accompanying figure have been added that show the
:  existence of e_i.

page 8, Proof of Lemma 1: "Otherwise, apply the same argument
inductively on the path from r' to x, to obtain ..."
Don't think you can apply the argument inductively, because r' may be
a Q-node, unlike r which is a P-node. Please make sure there is no bug
here.

:  This proof has been fixed.  We now only apply induction on P-nodes.
  
page 9, Figure 4: "Yellow leaves ..."
Will this figure appear in color?

:  Changed this to shaded leaves.

page 10, Proof of Lemma 2: This proof had me confused and and I hope
you can add explanation/figures to make it clearer. Here are some
concerns.
- The argument in second para of proof seems to use the fact that,
except for the edges of the reflex chain C_w, all remaining edges
of w are edges of polygon P (associated with the root of T). Am I
correct? Please clarify this as you see fit.

:  Yes, the referee is correct.  We have added some clarification.
:  In particular, that P\w is a half-polygon and has the same convexity
:  property as a half-space; if both endpoints of s are in P\w then the
:  entire line segment s is in P\w.

I assume the path P_x is going up from x towards the root. 

:  Correct, and this has been clarified.

From the
last para of the proof, I got the impression that you think the
path P_x ends in a T-node of type 0. Am I correct? If so, please
explain why it must end in a T-node of type 0 (and not a T-node of
Type 1 or Type 2). I also didn't understand why this T-node has to
be adjacent to a Type 1 or Type 2 node. Please add explanation.

:  This has been clarified.  The parent of a T-node is always a P-node and
:  P-nodes are never of Type 0.  Therefore, the parent of a Type 0 T-Node is
:  a Type 1 or Type 2 P-Node.  We already counted the number of Type 1 and 2
:  nodes, so now all we have to do is relate this to the number Type 0 nodes.

"Looking more closely at the definition of Q-nodes, we see that two
sibling Q-nodes x and y are not mutually visible ..." Guess one
exception to this are the immediate children of a T-node. For
example, a segment can intersect both Q_0 and Q_1 in Figure 4.

:  The referee is correct, and we have clarified this.

page 10, just before Lemma 3: "Instead, we require following stronger
result:"
Should read: "Instead, we require the following stronger result:"

:  Fixed.

page 11, line 4: This is the inequality with 3 summations. The
parenthesis are incorrectly placed. Should be:
Pr(t* \cap t) ( log(1 / Pr(t* \cap t)) - log c_i )

:  Fixed.

page 11, line 3 after Proof of Lemma 3: "... let t(x) = x \setminus
(\cup_{i=1}^m x_i) ..."
Should be: "... let t(x) = x \setminus (\cup_{i=1}^k x_i) ..."

:  Fixed.

page 12: In the second and third equations (line 3 and line 4) on top
of page, I think "log log (1 / Pr(t))" should be replaced by "2 log
log (1 / Pr(t))".

:  Fixed.

page 13, line 1: replace (x^2 ln 2) / 2 by (x ln 2)^2 / 2.

:  Fixed.

page 13, middle: "Where the last inequality ..."
Replace "Where" by "where" (i.e., use lower case).

:  Fixed.

page 15, middle: "Adding these edges will not increase the entropy the
minimum weight triangulation ..."
Insert "of" before "the".

:  Fixed.

page 17: In the fourth inequality for H(Delta), where you apply
Jensen's inequality, one closed parenthesis is missing.

:  Fixed.

page 12: I think a very small change in your analysis can improve the
lower-order term in all your results from H^{2/3} to H^{1/2}. Consider
the fourth step in the chain of inequalities for bounding
\overline{H}. For i in I^-, you upper bound Pr(\cup G_i) log(1 /
Pr(\cup G_i)) by (2^{alpha i} / 2^{i-1}) log(2^i). I believe you can
improve the upper bound on this quantity to: (2^{alpha i} /2^{i-1})
log(2^{i-1} / 2^{alpha i}).

:  This is correct and does, indeed, improve the lower-order term in the
:  query time.  Thanks for pointing this out.  We have modified the paper
:  accordingly and added an acknowledgement.
