We develop a number of space-efficient tools including an approach to
simulate divide-and-conquer space-efficiently, stably selecting and
unselecting a subset from a sorted set, and computing the $k$th
smallest element in one dimension from a multi-dimensional set that is
sorted in another dimension.  We then apply these tools to solve
several geometric problems that have solutions using some form of
divide-and-conquer. Specifically, we present solutions running in
\Oh{n \log n} time using \Oh{1} extra memory given inputs of size $n$
for the closest pair problem and the bichromatic closest pair 
problem.  For the orthogonal line segment intersection problem, we
solve the problem in \Oh{n\log n + k} time using \Oh{\log n} extra
space where $n$ is the number of horizontal and vertical line segments
and $k$ is the number of intersections.
