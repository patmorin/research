\section{A Grid Puzzle}

\noindent\emph{Pat Morin}

Consider the following game/puzzle played on the $n\times n$ integer
grid $G=\{(i,j):i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\}$.  Initially, all points in $G$
are marked as \emph{live}.  

The game proceeds in $n$
rounds. During the $i$th round, the player selects a monotonically
increasing set, $P_i$, of live points in $G$.\footnote{Here monotonically
increasing means that each point in $P_i$ has a unique $x$-coordinate
and $y$-coordinate and, for every $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)\in P_i$, $x_1 <
x_2\Leftrightarrow y_1<y_2$.}  Each point $(x,y)$ selected in $P_i$
\emph{kills} the L-shape $\{(x,y'): y'\ge y\}\cup\{(x',y):x'\ge x\}$ so 
that these points are no longer live in subsequent rounds. 

The game ends after $n$ rounds and the player's score is $\sum_{i=1}^n |P_i|$.

\begin{op}
   What is the maximum score a player can earn in this game?
\end{op}

By playing a cluster of $\sqrt{n}$ points in each round starting with a cluster
in the top-right corner, a player can earn a score of $\Omega(n^{3/2})$:

This seems optimal, but I've been unable to prove it.

\newcommand{\nested}{\raisebox{-.1ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.6ex]{figs/triangles-vertex-2}}}

\noindent History: this game models a combinatorial geometry problem
posed by Bra\ss\ (2004) of determining the maximum number of triangles
one can draw on a convex point set before creating a pair of triangles
that (a)~share an edge and cross (\taco) or (b)~share a vertex but whose edges
oppposite the shared vertex are ``nested'' (\nested).

\section{Facial Nonrepetitive Colouring of Trees}

\noindent\emph{Vida Dujmovi\'c}

A non-empty even-length sequence $S$ is a \emph{repetition} if it is the
concatenation of two equal non-empty sequences; in other words, $S$ is
a repetition if $S=RR$ for some non-empty sequence $R$.  A \emph{block}
in a sequence is a non-empty contiguous subsequence.  A sequence $S$ is
\emph{nonrepetitive} if none of its blocks is a repetition. (Nonrepetitive
sequences are also sometimes called \emph{square free} since they have
no block of the form $RR=R^2$.)

A classic result of Thue, from 1906, states that there are arbitrarily
long nonrepetitive sequences on an alphabet of size 3.  This notion has
been generalized to graph colourings, where we say that a colouring of
a graph $G$ is \emph{nonrepetitive} if, for every (simple) path, $P$,
in $G$, the sequence of $P$'s colours is not a repetition.

This question asks about nonrepetitive colourings of trees.  It is known
that every tree has a nonrepetitive 4-colouring and that this is optimal
for some trees. Here is a warm-up question, that would only need a slight
generalization of Thue's result:

\begin{op}\oplabel{thue-easy}
  Let $T^3_n$ be the tree having one vertex of degree 3 attached to three
  paths of length $n$.  Does $T^3_n$ have a nonrepetitive 3-colouring?
\end{op}

\noindent\textbf{Update:} We managed to prove that $T^3_n$
does indeed have a nonrepetitive 3-colouring, though the proof
does not look like it has much chance of generalizing.  (If you're
not worried about poisoning your own thoughts on this problem, see
\url{http://cglab.ca/~morin/misc/bb2016/drafts/starcolour.pdf}.)

A \emph{facial path} in an embedded graph, $G$, is a path that appears
as a block in the facial walk of some face of $G$.  A \emph{facial
nonrepetitive colouring} of $G$ is a colouring where, for each facial
path, $P$, of $G$, the sequence of colours encountered in $P$ is not
a repetition. It is known, for example, that every plane graph has a
facial nonrepetitive 22-colouring.

\begin{op}\oplabel{facial-tree-colouring}
  Does every (ordered) tree have a facial nonrepetitive 3-colouring? 
\end{op}

Note that the facial nonrepetitive 22-colouring of plane graphs
uses nonrepetitive colouring of trees as a building block (twice), so
solving \opref{facial-tree-colouring} would give a facial nonrepetitive
20-colouring of plane graphs.

\section{Optimal Isotopic Embedding}

\noindent\emph{G\"unter Rote}

We are given a (small) undirected \emph{guest graph} $G=(V_0,E_0)$
and a larger undirected \emph{host graph} $H=(V,E)$.
Both graphs are embedded in the plane.
We look for an isotopic embedding from $G$ to $H$ with
a given vertex assignment $V_0\mapsto V$. This means that
the edges $e\in E_0$ have to be mapped to edge-disjoint
paths $p(e)$ in $H$ such that the resulting image of $p(G)$ is obtained
from $G$ by a deformation of the plane. The face structure, orientation,
etc.\ of $G$ must be preserved, except that different edges $p(e)$
and $p(e')$ are allowed to ``touch'' (but not cross) at vertices.
(As an alternative, we might also ask for vertex-disjoint embeddings of edges.)

In addition, we are given a nonnegative cost function
$c_e\colon E\to R$, separately for each edge $e\in E_0$ that is to be embedded.
The objective is to minimize the total cost
$\sum_{e\in E_0} \sum_{f \in p(e)} c_e(f)$.

What is the complexity of this problem for small fixed
graphs $G$? For example, when $G$ is a triangle?

When $|V_0|=2$ and $G$ consists just of parallel edges,

I can model the problem as a dual network flow problem and solve it
in polynomial time.

\section{Straightening Monotone Drawings}

\noindent\emph{G\"unter Rote}

We are given a plane drawing of a graph where every
edge is both $x$-monotone and $y$-monotone.
\begin{op}
Can such a drawing always be straightened in such a way
that the edges are $x$-monotone and $y$-monotone
in the same sense as before?
\end{op}
It is know than it can be done with at most one bend per edge.

\section{Free Edge in Planar UDGs}

\noindent\emph{Ahmad Biniaz}

A \emph{free edge} in a unit disk graph is an edge which is not
intersected by other edges. There are some UDGs that have no free
edge. The question is:

\begin{op}
  Does any planar UDG have a free edge?
\end{op}

\noindent (Note the qualifier \emph{planar} (as opposed to \emph{plane}) in the
preceding problem.)


\section{Plane Red Blue Matchings}

\noindent\emph{Ahmad Biniaz}

We have a set $R$ of red points and a set $B$ of blue points in the plane such that ($R\cup B$) is in general position and $|R|+|B|$ is a big number. We want to match the red points together and the blue points together so that the union of these two matchings is non-crossing. It may not be possible to compute a perfect non-crossing matching even if both $|R|$ and $|B|$ are even numbers. In 2001, Dumitrescu and Kaye [1] showed that it is possible to match $85.71\%$ of the total number of points. They also showed there are large point sets which do not admit a plane matching which matches more than $98.95\%$ of the points. 

\begin{op}
  Improve these lower and upper bounds.
\end{op}

\section{Grid Point Sets With No Convex $n$-gons}

\noindent\emph{Ruy Fabila}

\begin{op}
  Does there exist, for every $\gamma \ge 1$ and every $n >0$, a suitable constant $\varepsilon(\gamma)>0$ and a set $S$
  of $n$ points in general position in the plane
  with the following property:
 $S$ has positive integer coordinates not exceeding $n^\gamma$, and $S$ does not contain a convex $\varepsilon(\gamma)\log_2(n)$-gon?
\end{op}

\begin{op}\label{prob:int_empty}
 Does the following holds for every constant $\gamma \ge 0$? 
 Every sufficiently large set of $n$ points in the general position in the plane with positive integer coordinates that do not exceed
 $n^{\gamma}$ contains an empty convex $7$-gon.
\end{op}

\section{Packing and Covering $K_4$'s in a Graph}

\noindent\emph{Abdul Basit}

Given a graph $G$, we would like to make $G$ $K_4$-free by deleting a
small number of edges. An obvious approach to do this is the following:
Let $F$ be a maximal family of pairwise edge disjoint $K_4$'s in
$G$. Clearly we need to delete at least one edge from every element of
$F$, and it suffices to delete all edges from every element of $F$. Let
$\nu(G)$ be the maximum size of an edge-disjoint family of $K_4$'s in
$G$, and $\tau(G)$ be the minimum number of edges required to delete
every $K_4$ in $G$. The above argument shows that $\nu(G) \leq \tau(G)
\leq {4 \choose 2} \nu(G)$. The lower bound is sharp, as seen by taking
$G$ to be the disjoint union of $K_4$'s. Taking $G$ to be $K_8$ shows
that $\tau(G)$ can be as large as $3.5 \nu(G)$.

\begin{op}
Does there exist a constant $c$ such that $\tau(G) \leq ({4 \choose 2}
- c) \nu(G)$?
\end{op}


\section{Minimal Rectangle Tilings}

\noindent\emph{Andrew Winslow}

Klarner [1969] defined the \emph{order} of a polyomino to be the smallest number of copies that tile a rectangle. Polyominoes with order $4s$ are known for all $s$ [Golomb 1989], as well as a small number of other even orders [Marshall 1997]. It was proved that no polyomino has order 3 [Stewart, Wormstein 1992] using a long case analysis, but results for larger odd n remain open:

\begin{op}
Does there exist a polyomino with odd order $n > 3$?
\end{op}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{figs/tiling.pdf}\\
  {The smallest rectangle tiled by this polyomino (of order 138).}
\end{center}

A similar problem has been considered for general polygons. For every prime number $n$, a square can be tiled using $n$ congruent copies of a polygon using rectangles arranged in a single column. In the 1980s, Danzer conjectured that no other tilings exist; this conjecture was confirmed for $n = 3$ [Maltby 1994] and $n = 5$ for the special case of convex polygons [Yuan, Zamfirescu, Zamfirescu 2016].

\begin{op}
Does there exist a tiling of a square using a prime number of congruent copies of a non-rectangular polygon?
\end{op}

\section{Approximation Algorithms for Slope Number}

The slope number of a graph is the minimum number of slopes of edges
needed in a drawing of the graph, with the edges drawn as straight line
segments, but allowing edges to cross. It is known that the slope number
is at least $\Delta/2$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree, but that
there exist bounded-degree graphs with unbounded slope number. It is
also known that planar graphs of bounded degree have bounded slope number
(exponential in the degree) and that testing whether the slope number is
two is NP-complete. It remains NP-complete for testing whether a planar
graph has a planar drawing with slope number two.

\begin{op}
  What can we say about approximating the slope number, either of all
  graphs, of all planar drawings of planar graphs, or of some interesting
  subclasses of graphs. Are there graph classes with unbounded slope number
  for which we can approximate this number accurately? Alternatively,
  can we prove any inapproximability results for slope number?
\end{op}

\section{Plane spanners of points in convex position} 

\newcommand{\CH}{\mathord{\it CH}}

\emph{Michiel Smid} 

Let $S$ be a finite and non-empty set of points in the plane that is in 
convex position, and let $\CH(S)$ denote the convex hull of $S$. 
For two points $p$ and $q$ of $S$, 
\begin{itemize}
\item let $|pq|$ denote their Euclidean distance and 
\item let $|pq|_{\partial \CH(S)}$ denote their shortest-path distance 
      along the boundary of $\CH(S)$. 
\end{itemize} 
We say that a point $p$ of $S$ is $t$-\emph{good in} $S$, if for each 
point $q$ of $S$, 
\[ |pq|_{\partial \CH(S)} \leq t |pq| . 
\]
Define 
\[ \begin{array}{ll} 
       t^* = \inf \{ t : & \mbox{each finite and non-empty set of 
                                 points in convex position} \\ 
         & \mbox{has at least one $t$-good point} \} .
   \end{array} 
\]   

For any $t>t^*$, the following algorithm constructs a plane $t$-spanner 
for any finite and non-empty set $S$ of points in convex position:  
\begin{itemize} 
\item Initialize $E = \emptyset$.  
\item While $|S| \geq 4$: 
      \begin{itemize} 
      \item Let $p$ be any $t$-good point in $S$. 
      \item Let $q$ and $r$ be $p$'s neighbors along $\CH(S)$. 
      \item Add the edges $pq$, $pr$, and $qr$ to $E$. 
      \item Let $S = S \setminus \{p\}$. 
      \end{itemize} 
\item Add the edges of $\CH(S)$ to $E$. 
\item Return the graph with edge set $E$. 
\end{itemize} 

\begin{op} 
What is the value of $t^*$? 
\end{op} 

Let $pq$ be a diametral pair in the point set $S$. We have recently 
shown that both $p$ and $q$ are $1.88$-good. In fact, this remains 
true if we take for $pq$ a sufficiently good approximation to the 
diameter of $S$. 

Consider the set $S$ consisting of the three vertices of an equilateral  
triangle, together with the three points at the midpoints of the 
edges. It is easy to verify that none of the points in $S$ is 
$(\sqrt{3} - \epsilon)$-good for any $\epsilon>0$. 

Thus, the currently best known bounds for $t^*$ are 
\[ \sqrt{3} \leq t^* \leq 1.88 . 
\] 
As a result, we obtain, for any set of points in convex position, a 
plane spanner with stretch factor $1.88$. The previously best known 
stretch factor for plane spanners was $1.998$, which is attained by the 
Delaunay triangulation and, in fact, also holds for point sets that 
are not in convex position. 

\section{Flipping Edge-Labelled Pseudotriangulations}

\noindent\emph{Sander Verdonschot}

A pseudo-triangle is a simple polygon with three convex interior
angles, called \emph{corners}, connected by reflex chains.
Given a simple polygon $P$, a \emph{pseudo-triangulation} of $P$ is a
subdivision of its interior into pseudo-triangles, using only the
vertices of $P$.
Pseudo-triangulations support a flip operation analogous to the one
for triangulations.
It is known that any pseudo-triangulation of $P$ can be transformed
into any other by flips.
An \emph{edge-labeled} pseudo-triangulation of $P$ is one in which
every interior edge has a unique label.
Flipping an edge transfers the label from the removed edge to the new
edge.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{figs/edge-flip.pdf}
\end{center}
 
\begin{op}
  Can every edge-labeled pseudo-triangulation be transformed into every
other via flips? If not, can we decide which pairs can be transformed
into each other and which cannot?
\end{op}

%\section{Spinning Trident Spanners}
%
%\noindent\emph{Joe O'Rourke}
%
%Given $n$ points $P$ in the plane,
%the Yao graph $Y_k$ partitions the plane around each point $p \in P$ by a \emph{$k$-fan}
%into $k$ sectors of equal
%angular measure, and connects $p$ to the closest point in each sector.
%The sectors are all oriented equally with respect to a global coordinate system.
%Here I imagine the natural situation where each $k$-fan can be oriented differently,
%allowing for the possibility of improving various aspects of the resulting graph
%without requiring more ``hardware."
%
%Although one could ask many question (e.g.: What is the best spanning ratio of
%spinning $Y_k$'s for $k \ge 4$?), I propose to focus on
%$Y_3$, because it is known that $Y_3$ is not a spanner, % [Nawar],
%but $Y_4$ is a spanner. 
%Nawar's $Y_3$ counterexample relies crucially on all the tridents being ``parallel"
%in the sense that all are oriented identically.
%
%\begin{op}
%If each trident is permitted to reorient 
%independently about its fixed center,
%does this guarantee a spanner?
%\end{op}
%
%
%It is not difficult to show that allowing the $2$-fans of $Y_2$ to reorient does not
%guarantee a spanner.  So $Y_3$ lies at a critical juncture in this spectrum of problems.

\section{Constant-Degree Spanners}

\noindent\emph{Mirela Damian}

A graph is a spanner if a shortest path between any pair of points in the
graph is no longer than a constant times the Euclidean distance between
the two points.  The Yao graph $Y_k$ and the Theta graph $\Theta_k$
are defined for a given point set and a fixed integer $k > 0$. The space
around each point is divided into $k$ cones of equal angle, and each point
is connected to a nearest neighbor in each cone. The difference between
Yao and Theta graphs is in the way the nearest neighbor is defined: Yao
graphs minimize the Euclidean distance, whereas Theta graphs minimize
the \emph{projective} distance, measured from the cone origin to the
orthogonal projection of the neighbor on the cone bisector.

The graph \emph{half}-$\Theta_6$ is composed of the edges of $\Theta_6$
that lie in non-consecutive cones. Thus $\Theta_6$ is the union of two
edge-disjoint half-$\Theta_6$ graphs.  Each half-$\Theta_6$ graph is a
triangular distance Delaunay graph and is a $2$-spanner of the complete
Euclidean graph (Bonichon et al 2010).

Each of $\Theta_k$ and $Y_k$ has out-degree $k$, but in-degree $n-1$. To
reduce the in-degrees, the Yao-Yao graph $YY_k \subseteq Y_k$ is obtained
from $Y_k$ by discarding from each cone all incoming edges, with the
exception of a shortest one; ties are broken arbitrarily. The graphs
$\Theta\Theta_k \subseteq \Theta_k$ and half-$\Theta\Theta_6 \subseteq$
half-$\Theta_6$ are similarly defined.

\begin{op}
At last year's workshop we showed that $\Theta\Theta_6$ is not a spanner (writeup available online at \url{http://csc.villanova.edu/~mdamian/tt6.pdf}). Is $\Theta\Theta_6$ a spanner for points in convex position? What about half-$\Theta\Theta_6$ (this would have the advantage of being planar)? These problems might not be too difficult to tackle. 
\end{op}

\begin{op}
The smallest known $k$ for which $\Theta\Theta_k$ and $YY_k$ are spanners is $k = 30$. Is there a value $k < 30$ for which $\Theta\Theta_k$ and/or $YY_k$ is a spanner? The case $k = 12$ appears to be the simplest (just split the $\Theta_6$ cones in half), because we might be able to use the planarity (and low spanning ratio) of half-$\Theta_6$.
\end{op}

\section{Universal Drawings of $K_m$}

\noindent\emph{Fabrizio Frati}

\begin{op} \label{pr:universal}
For every $n$ we ask: What is the smallest $m=f(n)$ such that there exists a drawing $\Gamma$ of the complete graph $K_m$ such that, for every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, drawing $\Gamma$ contains a planar drawing of $G$?
\end{op} 

This problem is a purely topological version of the well-known ``universal point set'' problem for planar graphs. Indeed, if the drawing of $K_m$ were required to be straight-line, then the problem would be exactly the same as finding the cardinality of a smallest set $U$ of $m$ points such that every $n$-vertex planar graph admits a straight-line drawing on an $n$-vertex subset of $U$ -- the ``universal point set'' problem for planar graphs. In Problem~\ref{pr:universal}, the drawing $\Gamma$ needs not to be straight-line.

The problem clearly derives known upper bounds from the universal point set problem, so:

\begin{itemize}
\item The answer is $m=n$ if we are only interested in finding a drawing $\Gamma$ that contains a planar drawing of every $n$-vertex outer-planar graph or every $n$-vertex tree.
\item The answer is $m=O(n^{1.5}\log n)$ if we are only interested in finding a drawing $\Gamma$ that contains a planar drawing of every $n$-vertex series-parallel graph or every $n$-vertex planar $3$-tree.
\item The answer is $m=O(n^2)$ in general.
\end{itemize}

No lower bound greater than $n$ seems to emerge from the literature. A strong relationship is also evident with other problems such as the universal point set problem for polyline drawings of planar graphs.
