\item Compute the maximum $\alpha$ such that all points have
$\alpha$-wedge depth 0.

\item Compute the smallest value of $\alpha$ such that $\alpha$-wedge
depth of $p$ is the same as the Tukey depth of $p$ for all $p\in\mathbb{R}^2$.

\item Ivan's question about generalized Tukey depth.  Let $H_u$ be the
closed halfspace with inner normal $u$.
\[
    d_{\tau,w}(p) = \inf_{\|u\|=1}
          2(1-\tau)|H_u\cap H_w|
         + 2\tau|H_{u}\cap H_{-w}| 
         - |H_u\cap H_{w}\cap H_{-w}|
\]

\item Does there exist an FPT for computing the Tukey depth.  I.e.,
with running time $O((ndk)^c\times f(k))$.

\item What do $\alpha$-wedge depth contours look like?

\item What about $\alpha$-wedge depth in 3d?

\item Tukey depth with limited range (defining object is half-disk of
radius $r$).

\item Strip depth (defining object is strips of width $r$).
