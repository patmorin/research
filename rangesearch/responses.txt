4.-
This section seems overly verbose in an otherwise easy to read paper. The two "unsuccessful" lower bounds aren't very informative, and considering that the actual lower bound is more of a "hand waving" argument, they seem redundant. Do you really need to formally present Shannon's theorem?

Response: We have left these lower bounds in because we feel that they distinguish the problem from previous work on point-location in structures like triangulations.  For example, even with quadratic space, it would not be possible to match either of these entropy lower-bounds.

We call a node v at even distance form the root a vertical node, otherwise we call v a horizontal node
We call a node v at even distance form the root a horizontal node; otherwise we call v a vertical node

Response: The first sentence is correct.  The root (at distance 0 from the root) is a vertical node.  After that, the nodes alternate.

6.46
"above" r(v)... "to the right of" r(v)
s(v)?

Response: In this case, r(v) is correct.  All these points must be in v's catalogues since any query that ends at any descendant of v will be located in one of v's catalogues. 

9.15
two catalogues
one catalogue?

Response: One x-catalogue and one y-catalogue.

This implies that G has a vertex v of degree at most 2^{i/2+1}
This implies that the maximum degree of G is 2^{i/2+1}

This isn't quite true.  A very large rectangle R in G can have high degree because there are many lines that stab R and some other rectangle.  It is only by averaging over the total degree that we guarantee that at least one vertex has small degree.

14. Open problem 5
Why can't your structure be extended to d dimensions? I suspect you would pick up O(d) slack in the runtime.

The main problem is that, in d dimensions, there are no near-linear space data structures that have logarithmic query time.  Since all our lower-bounds are based on entropy, our lower-bounds will never be super-logarithmic, so they will never come close to matching the query times of near-linear space data structures.  It seems that new lower-bounding techniques are required for this case.


Referee 2:

Conclusions Section: please comment on the current status of these
open problems in light of the new developments.

Response: Because of Afshani et al.'s result, several of the open problems (1 and 4) are no longer open.  Open Problem 3 was also removed because, as the referee points out, it doesn't make sense.
