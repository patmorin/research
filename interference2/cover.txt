Dear Editor,

Herein is our submission,

A Note on Interference in Random Networks
by Luc Devroye and Pat Morin

that we are submitting for consideration by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.

This paper is a primarily theoretical contribution in the sense that it analyses maximum interference in random networks using probability theory.  However, the results of this analysis show that, for random networks, maximum interference is much much lower than has been shown in the worst-case by von Rickenbach et al.  Thus, a practical lesson from this is that interference minimization is not such an important concern in random networks.

Best regards,
Pat Morin
