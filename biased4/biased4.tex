\begin{abstract}
Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in $\R^2$ and let $D$ be a probability
measure over the space of all axis-aligned rectangles in $\R^2$.
We describe a data structure that preprocesses $P$ and $D$ to answer
rectangular range counting queries over $P$.  When the queries are drawn
according to $D$, the expected query time of this data structure does
not exceed, by more than a constant factor, the expected cost of any
comparison tree for answering rectangular range counting queries over $P$
for queries drawn according to $D$.
