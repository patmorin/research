Suppose we have a set $P$ of $r$ points in the plane such that, for every
$j\in\{i,\ldots,i+t-1\}$, there exists a line $L_j$ such that the
projection of $P$ onto $L_j$ defines exactly $j$ unique values.  Our goal
is to upper-bound $t$ in terms of $i$ using the Szemeredi-Trotter Theorem:

For any set of $\ell$ lines and $r$ points, the number of point-line
incidences does not exceed $c(\ell r)^{2/3}$.

Each $L_j$ defines $j$ lines orthogonal to $L_j$ that pass through all the
points of $P$.  This gives a total of 
\[
   \ell = \sum_{j=i}^{i+t-1} j = ti + t(t-1)/2 < ti + t^2/2
\]
lines.  The total number of incidences between these lines and $P$ is
exactly $tr$.  By the Szemeredi-Trotter Theorem, we get the inequality
\[
    tr \le c(\ell r)^{2/3} \le c((ti+t^2/2)r)^{2/3}  \enspace ,
\]
which, using the inequality $r \ge i+t-1$, we can rewrite to obtain
\[
    (1-c/2)t \le i   \enspace .
\]
This would give a linear bound for any $c < 2$.  The best bound on $c$ that
I could find (with only a few minutes to search) is $c\le 3.24$, which is
in the Wikipedia article.
