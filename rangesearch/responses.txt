4.-
This section seems overly verbose in an otherwise easy to read paper. The two "unsuccessful" lower bounds aren't very informative, and considering that the actual lower bound is more of a "hand waving" argument, they seem redundant. Do you really need to formally present Shannon's theorem?

Response: We have left these lower bounds in because we feel that they distinguish the problem from previous work on point-location in structures like triangulations.  For example, even with quadratic space, it would not be possible to match either of these entropy lower-bounds.

We call a node v at even distance form the root a vertical node, otherwise we call v a horizontal node
We call a node v at even distance form the root a horizontal node; otherwise we call v a vertical node

Response: The first sentence is correct.  The root (at distance 0 from the root) is a vertical node.  After that, the nodes alternate.
