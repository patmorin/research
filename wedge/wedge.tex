\begin{abstract}
The \emph{Centerpoint Theorem} states that, for any set $S$ of $n$
points in $\R^d$, there exists a point $p$ in $\R^d$
such that every closed halfspace containing $p$ contains at least
$\ceil{n/(d+1)}$ points of $S$.  We consider generalizations of the
Centerpoint Theorem in which halfspaces are replaced with wedges
(cones) of angle $\alpha$.  In $\R^2$, we give bounds that are tight
for all values of $\alpha$ and give an $O(n)$ time algorithm to find a
point satisfying these bounds.  We also give partial results for 
$\R^3$ and, more generally, $\R^d$.

\section{Introduction}

Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in $\R^d$.  The \emph{halfspace
depth} \cite{t75} of a point $p$ with respect to $S$ is defined as
\[
D_\pi(p,S) = 
   \min\{|h\cap S| : \mbox{$h$ is a closed halfspace that contains $p$} \}
    \enspace .
\]
The \emph{Centerpoint Theorem}, which is a simple consequence of
Helly's Theorem \cite{e93}, states that for any point set $S$ of size
$n$ there exists a point whose halfspace depth is at least
$\ceil{n/(d+1)}$.  Furthermore, for every $n>0$, there exists a point
set $S$ in $\R^d$ of size $n$ for which no point in
$\R^d$ has halfspace depth greater than $\ceil{n/(d+1)}$. 

In this paper we consider a generalization of halfspace depth that we
call \emph{$\alpha$-wedge depth}. Let $r$ be a ray with endpoint $q$.
An $\alpha$-wedge with apex $q$ and axis $r$ is the point $q$ plus 
the set of all points
$p$ such that the angle\footnote{We use the convention that the angle
between two line segments (or, in this case, a ray and a line segment)
with an endpoint in common is the smaller of the two angles occuring
at the common point.} between $pq$ and $r$ is at most $\alpha/2$.  The
$\alpha$-wedge depth of a point $p$ with respect to a point set $S$ is
defined as
\[
D_\alpha(p,S) =
   \min\{|h\cap S| : \mbox{$h$ is an $\alpha$-wedge that contains $p$} \} 
   \enspace .
\]

Several authors have studied $\alpha$-wedge depth and related notions.
The set of point in $S$ with $\alpha$-wedge depth 1 are called
\emph{unoriented $\alpha$-maxima} by Avis \etal\ \cite{abd99} who study
their computational and combinatorial properties.  Abellenas \etal\
\cite{achs02} study $(\alpha,k)$-sets in the plane.  These are the
subsets of $S$ that can be separated from the remainder of $S$ by an
$\alpha$-wedge.  In particular, every $(\alpha,k)$ set defines a locus
of points whose $\alpha$-wedge depth is at most $k$.  Several authors
have studied the use of $\alpha$-floodlights ($\alpha$-wedges) for
illuminating regions of the plane \cite{ecoux95,mo01}.

In the current paper, we consider bounds on the points of maximum
$\alpha$-wedge depth.
Define the function $f^d_\alpha(n)$ as follows:
\[
   f^d_\alpha(n) = \min\left\{\max\{D_\alpha(p,S):p\in
\R^d\}: S\subseteq\R^d\, ,\, |S|=n\right\}
\]
That is, $f^d_\alpha$ defines, for each $n$, the maximum value $k$ for
which every point set $S$ of size $n$ is guaranteed to define a point
whose $\alpha$-wedge depth with respect to $S$ is at least $k$.  The
Centerpoint Theorem states that $f^d_\pi(n) = \ceil{n/(d+1)}$.  In this paper
we prove the following Theorem about 2-dimensional point sets:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{twod-result}
\[
   f^2_\alpha(n) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                        1 & \mbox{if $\alpha < \pi$} \\
                        \ceil{n/3} & \mbox{if $\pi\le \alpha < 4\pi/3$} \\
                        \ceil{n/2} & \mbox{if $4\pi/3\le \alpha < 2\pi$} \\
                        n & \mbox{if $\alpha = 2\pi$\enspace .} 
                       \end{array}\right.
\]
Furthermore, for any $\alpha$ and any point set $S$ of size $n$, a
point $p$ such that $D_\alpha(p,S) \ge
f^2_\alpha(n)$ can be found in $O(n)$ expected time.
\end{thm}

We also prove some partial results about $f^d_\alpha$ for dimensions
$d\ge 3$.  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  In
\secref{2d} we fully characterize $f^2_\alpha$.  In \secref{dd} we
give a partial characterization of $f^d_\alpha$.  In \secref{3d} we
refine this characterization for the special case $d=3$.  Finally, in
\secref{conclusions} we summarize and conclude with open problems.

\comment{
then generalize the bounds of \thmref{twod-result} to point sets in
$\R^d$ and obtain the following theorem:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{dd-result}
Let $\theta_d = 2\pi - \blah{d}$.  Then
\[
   f^d_\alpha(n) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                        1 & \mbox{if $\alpha < \pi$} \\
                        \ceil{n/(d+1)} & \mbox{if $\pi\le \alpha < \theta_d$} \\
                        \ceil{n/2} & \mbox{if $\theta_d\le \alpha < 2\pi$} \\
                        n & \mbox{if $\alpha = 2\pi$\enspace .} 
                       \end{array}\right.
\]
\end{thm} 
The constant $\theta_d$ in \thmref{dd-result} appears in the following
way.  It is the angle $\alpha$ of the smallest $\alpha$-wedge whose
apex is a the center of a regular $d$-simplex and that contains $d$ of
the $d+1$ vertices of this simplex.
}

\section{Proof of \thmref{twod-result}}
\seclabel{2d}

In this section we prove a sequence of lemmata that immediately imply
\thmref{twod-result}.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{a}
If $\alpha < \pi$ then $f^2_\alpha(n) = 1$ and a point $p$ such that
$D_\alpha(p,S)\ge 1$ can be found in $O(1)$ time.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
To prove the lower bound, we observe that for any non-empty
point set $S$, every point $p\in S$ satisfies $D_\alpha(p,S)\ge 1$, so
$f^2_\alpha(n) \ge 1$. This proves the lower bound and gives an $O(1)$
time algorithm for finding $p$. 

For the upper bound, consider a set $S$ of points that are all
on the $x$-axis.  For any point $p$ on or above the $x$ axis, the
$\alpha$-wedge whose axis is vertical and upwards intersects the $x$
axis in at most one point, therefore $D_\alpha(p,S) \le 1$.  For any
point $p$ below the $x$ axis, the $\alpha$-wedge whose axis is
vertical and downwards does not intersect the $x$ axis at all, so
$D_\alpha(p,S)=0$.  In either case, $D_\alpha(p,S)\le 1$ so $f^2_\alpha(n)
\le 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{b}
If $\pi\le \alpha < 4\pi/3$ then $f^2_\alpha(n) = \ceil{n/3}$ and a
point $p$ such that $D_\alpha(p,S)\ge \ceil{n/3}$ can be found in $O(n)$ time.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} 
For the lower bound, we observe that every $\alpha$-wedge containing
$p$ also contains a halfspace containing $p$.  Therefore, the
Centerpoint Theorem implies that $f^2_\alpha(n) \ge \ceil{n/3}$.  This
proves the lower bound and the algorithm of Jadhav and Mukhopadhyay
\cite{jm94} gives an $O(n)$ time algorithm for finding $p$.

For the upper bound, consider the following point set.  Start with
three rays originating at the origin such that each pair of rays meet at an
angle of $2\pi/3$.  Place $\ceil{n/3}$ or $\floor{n/3}$ points on each
ray, as appropriate, so that the total number of points is $n$.  For
any point $p\in\R^2$, there exists a $4\pi/3$-wedge whose apex
is at $p$ and whose interior intersects only one of the three rays
(the axis of this wedge is parallel to this ray). This $4\pi/3$ wedge
contains an $\alpha$-wedge that contains $p$ and intersects only one
of the three rays, therefore $D_\alpha(p,S)\le \ceil{n/3}$.  Since the
choice of $p$ is arbitrary, this implies that $f^2_\alpha(n) \le
\ceil{n/3}$.  
\end{proof}

The next part of the proof uses the notion of halving lines.  A
\emph{halving line in direction $d$} of a finite point set $S$,
$|S|=n$, is a line $\ell$ parallel to $d$ such that each of the 2
closed halfplanes bounded by $\ell$ contains at least
$\ceil{n/2}$ points of $S$.  So that halving lines are uniquely
defined by direction, we will use the convention that, if $n$ is even,
then the closest point of $S$ to the left of $\ell$ is at the same
distance from $\ell$ as the closest point of $S$ to the right of
$\ell$.  The following lemma was proven by Fekete and Meijer
\cite[Lemma~2]{fm00} in a different context.  However, for
completeness, we include a proof because an understanding of the
existence proof is required for the algorithm described in
\lemref{algorithm}.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{construction}
For any point set $S$ there exists three concurrent halving lines 
of $S$ such that the angle\footnote{We use the convention that
the angle between a pair of lines is the smaller of the two angles
defined by the two lines.} between any pair of lines is $\pi/3$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
To prove the existence of these three halving lines we start with one
vertical halving line, $\ell_1$, and the other two halving lines,
$\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$, forming angles of $\pi/3$ with $\ell_1$,
$\ell_2$ having positive slope and $\ell_3$ having negative slope
(\figref{existence}.a).  If these three halving lines are concurrent
then the construction is complete. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\includegraphics{existence-a} &
\includegraphics{existence-b} &
\includegraphics{existence-c} \\
(a) & (b) & (c)
\end{tabular}\end{center}
\caption{The existence of three concurrent halving lines that meet at angles of
$\pi/3$.}
\figlabel{existence}
\end{figure}
Otherwise, assume without loss of generality that $\ell_1$ is directed downwards and that
$\ell_2\cap \ell_3$ is to its right.  Imagine continuously rotating
the three lines while maintaining the invariant that they are all
halving lines and that the angle between any two is $\pi/3$.  After
having rotated the lines by an angle of $\pi$, the three halving lines
are identical to their initial configuration except that the direction
of $\ell_1$ is reversed, so now $\ell_2\cap\ell_3$ is to the left of
$\ell_1$ (\figref{existence}.c).  We conclude that at some point
during this process $\ell_2\cap\ell_3$ must have been on $\ell_1$
(\figref{existence}.b), at which point the three lines were
concurrent.  This completes proof.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{algorithm}
Three halving lines satisfying the conditions of \lemref{construction}
can be found in $O(n)$ time.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}

To find the three halving lines we apply the prune-and-search paradigm
in much the same way as the algorithm of Lo, Matou\v{s}ek, and Steiger
\cite{lms94} for finding planar ham-sandwich cuts.  By the standard
``computational geometry duality'' \cite[Section~1.3.3]{bkoo97}, our problem
is to find three points on the median level of $n$ lines such that
these points are collinear and their $x$-coordinates satisfy a certain
equation.  

More precisely, given a set $S^*$ of $n$ lines (that are dual to the
points of $S$), let
\[
    h_k(x) = \min\{ y : 
        \mbox{$(x,y)$ is on or above at least $k$ lines of
$S^*$}\} 
\]
and let $h=h_{\ceil{n_2}}$.  The set of all points $(x,y)$ satisfying
$y=h_k(x)$ is called the \emph{$k$-level} of $S^*$ or, for
$k=\ceil{n/2}$, the \emph{median level}.
The dual of our problem is to find a value $x$ such that the three points
$(x,h(x))$, $(g_1(x),h(g_1(x)))$ and $(g_2(x),h(g_2(x)))$ are collinear.
Here $g_1(x)=\blau{x}$ and
$g_2(x)=\bleu{x}$ which captures the condition that each pair of halving
lines form an angle of $\pi/3$.  [Informally, the continuity argument in
the proof of \lemref{construction} is equivalent to the observation
that, if the sequence of points $\langle(-\infty,h(-\infty)),
(g_1(-\infty),h(g_1(-\infty)), (g_2(-\infty),h(g_2(-\infty))\rangle$ form
a right (respectively left) turn then the points $\langle(\infty,h(\infty)),
(g_1(\infty),h(g_1(\infty)), (g_2(\infty),h(g_2(\infty))\rangle$ form a
left (respectively right) turn, so there must be some
$x\in(-\infty,\infty)$ such that 
$(x,h(x))$, $(g_1(x),h(g_1(x)))$ and $(g_2(x),h(g_2(x)))$ are
collinear.]

Each iteration in the algorithm of Lo \etal\ \cite{lms94} constructs,
in time linear in $|S^*|$, a trapezoid $T$ that is guaranteed to
contain a ham-sandwich point and that intersects at most $2n/3$ lines
of $S^*$.  The lines in $S^*$ not intersecting $T$ are then discarded
and the algorithm recurses on the remaining lines.  Since a constant
fraction of the lines are discarded in each iteration, the running
time of the algorithm is a geometrically decreasing series and is
therefore $O(|S^*|)$.

In our setting, we are searching for 3 points, so at each iteration we
construct three trapezoids $T$, $T_1$ and $T_2$ such that each
trapezoid intersects at most $\delta m$ lines, for an arbitrarily
small constant $\delta < 1/3$.  We then discard from $S^*$ any line
not intersecting any of the three trapezoids and recurse on the
remaining lines.  Each iteration (described below) takes $O(|S^*|)$
time and decreases the size of $S^*$ by a factor of $3\delta$, so the
entire algorithm runs in $O(|S^*|)=O(n)$ time.

Because the algorithm is recursive the subproblems it solves are
slightly more general than the original problem.  Given a set $S^*$ of
lines, two $x$-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$ and three integers $k$,
$k_1$ and $k_2$, the algorithm finds an $x$-coordinate $x\in[x_1,x_2]$
such that the three points $(x,h_k(x))$, $(g_1(x),h_{k_1}(g_1(x)))$
and $(g_2(x),h_{k_2}(g_2(x)))$ are collinear.  Such a value $x$ is
guaranteed \emph{a priori} to exist.  Note that, for our initial
recursive call we set $x_1=-\infty$, $x_2=\infty$, and
$k=k_1=k_2=\ceil{n/2}$.

All that remains is to show how to implement a single iteration of the
algorithm in $O(|S^*|)$ time.  To begin, we create a set $X$ of
$x$-coordinates that initially contains the values $x_1$ and $x_2$.
Next we add to $X$ an additional $O(1)$ values so that, for any two
consecutive elements of $X$, the arrangement of our $m$ lines contains
at most $(\delta m)^2/16$ vertices that have $x$-coordinates between
these two elements of $X$.  These additional values can be found in
$O(|S^*|)$ time using (e.g.) the algorithm of Matou\v{s}ek \cite{m91}
(or much more simply by random sampling).  Finally, for each value
$x\in X$ we add the values $g_1^{-1}(x)$ and $g_2^{-1}(x)$ to $X$.
This last step guarantees that, for any two consecutive elements
$x_1'$ and $x_2'$ of $X$, the arrangement of the lines in $S^*$
contains at most $(\delta m)^2/16$ vertices whose $x$ coordinates are
in the range $[g_1(x_1'),g_1(x_2')]$ (respectively
$[g_2(x_1'),g_2(x_2')]$). 

Now, using $O(|X|)=O(1)$ applications of a linear time selection
algorithm (e.g., \cite{bea73}) we can 
find, in $O(|S^*|)$ time, two consecutive elements $x_1'$
and $x_2'$ of $X$ such that $x_1',x_2'\in[x_1,x_2]$ and a solution to our
problem lies in the interval $[x_1',x_2']$.  Consider the trapezoid
$T$ whose four corners are given by $(x_1',h_{k\pm\floor{\delta
m/4}}(x_1'))$ and $(x_2',h_{k\pm\floor{\delta m/4}}(x_2'))$.  A simple
argument \cite{lms94} shows that this trapezoid intersects at
most $\delta m$ lines of $S^*$ and that the $k$-level of $S^*$ does
not intersect the top or bottom sides of this trapezoid.  Similarly,
there are trapezoids $T_1$ and $T_2$ defined by the four points 
$(g_1(x_1'),h_{k_1\pm\floor{\delta m/4}}(g_1(x_1')))$ and
$(g_1(x_2'),h_{k_1\pm\floor{\delta m/4}}(g_1(x_2')))$ and the four
points
$(g_2(x_1'),h_{k_1\pm\floor{\delta m/4}}(g_2(x_1')))$ and
$(g_2(x_2'),h_{k_1\pm\floor{\delta m/4}}(g_2(x_2')))$, respectively.
The inclusion of the elements of the form $g_1^{-1}(x)$ and
$g_2^{-1}(x)$ in the set $X$ guarantees that, neither $T_1$ 
nor $T_2$ intersect more than $\delta m$ lines in $S^*$
and the $k_1$-level (respectively $k_2$-level) of $S^*$ does not
intersect the top or bottom sides of $T_1$ (respectively $T_2$).

Altogether, this means that there are at least $m-3\delta m$ lines in
$S^*$ that do not intersect any of the trapezoids $T$, $T_1$ or $T_2$.
When we recurse, we discard these lines, set $x_1=x_1'$, $x_2=x_2'$,
and subtract from $k$ (respectively $k_1$ and $k_2$) the number of
discarded lines that pass below $T$ (respectively $T_1$ and $T_2$).
This completes the description of the algorithm and the proof of the
lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{c}
If $4\pi/3\le \alpha < 2\pi$ then $f^2_\alpha(n) = n/2$ and a point
$p$ such that $D_\alpha(p,S)\ge n/2$ can be found in $O(n)$ time.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
For the lower bound, consider the three halving lines whose existence
is given by \lemref{construction}.  These three halving lines
naturally define six $\pi/3$-wedges.  Observe that if we take $p$ to
be the common intersection point of the three halving lines then any
$\alpha$-wedge that contains $p$ contains at least 3 consecutive
$\pi/3$-wedges and therefore contains at least $\ceil{n/2}$ points of $S$
(because it contains a closed halfplane bounded by one of the
halving lines).  Therefore, $f^2_\alpha(n)\ge \ceil{n/2}$, and the
point $p$ such that $D_\alpha(p,S)\ge \ceil{n/2}$ can be found in $O(n)$
time using \lemref{algorithm}.

 
For the upper bound, we consider a point set in which the points have
been clustered into two groups of size $\floor{n/2}$ and $\ceil{n/2}$.
Each of the two groups is contained in a unit ball and the distance
between the two groups is very large, say $r$.  Now, observe that any
point $p\in\R^2$ must be at distance at least $r/2$ from at
least one of the two groups.  This means that, if $r$ is sufficiently
large, then there exists a $(2\pi-\alpha)$-wedge whose apex is $p$ and
that contains this group in its interior.  The complementary
$\alpha$-wedge contains $p$ and does not contain any points of this
group.  Therefore, $D_\alpha(p,S)\le \ceil{n/2}$.  Since $p$ was
chosen arbitrarily, we conclude that $f^2_\alpha(n)\le \ceil{n/2}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \thmref{twod-result}] 
The theorem follows immediately from \lemref{a}, \lemref{b}
and \lemref{c}.
\end{proof}

\section{Some Results for $\R^d$}\seclabel{ddim}
\seclabel{dd}

In this section, we consider $\alpha$-wedge depth in $\R^d$,
and prove  some bounds on the function $f^d_\alpha$.  The following
lemma results from exactly the same arguments used in the proofs of
\lemref{a}, \lemref{b} and \lemref{c} (namely points on a line, the
Centerpoint Theorem, and 2 small clusters of points, respectively).

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{dd-a}\lemlabel{combined}
$f^\alpha_d$ satisfies the following:
\[\begin{array}{lcll}
  f^d_\alpha(n) & = & 1 & \mbox{if $\alpha < \pi$} \\
  f^d_\alpha(n) & \ge & \ceil{n/(d+1)} & \mbox{if $\alpha \ge \pi$} \\
  f^d_\alpha(n) & \le & \ceil{n/2} & \mbox{if $\alpha < 2\pi$} \\
\end{array}\]
\end{lem}

The following technical lemma is needed for proving an upper bound
that generalizes the construction in \lemref{b}.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{cone-angle}
Let $T$ be a regular $d$-simplex whose center is at the origin.  Then,
for any $d$ vertices of $T$, there is a $2\arccos(1/d)$-wedge whose
apex is at the origin and that contains these $d$ vertices of $S$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} 
Wlog we can consider the regular $d$-simplex whose vertices are
$e_1,\ldots,e_d, ((1-\sqrt{d+1})/d)(e_1+\cdots+e_d)$ where $e_i$ is the
$i$th coordinate unit vector in $\R^d$.  The center of this
simplex is the point $c=\sqrt{d+1}/(d^2+d)(e_1+\cdots+ e_d)$.
Consider the ray $r$ that originates at $c$ and
contains the point $e_1+\cdots+e_d$.  The angle between $r$ and
$e_i$, for any $1\le i\le d$ is easily determined to be
$\arccos(1/d)$ using the famous formula 
\[
   \angle uv = \arccos \left(\frac{u\cdot v}{\|u\|\|v\|}\right) 
\]
for the angle between two vectors $u$ and $v$.   Thus,
the $d$-vertices $e_1,\ldots e_d$ are contained in the
$2\arccos(1/d)$-wedge whose axis is $r$, as required.
\end{proof}

The next lemma is a generalization of \lemref{b}.  Notice that
$2(\pi-\arccos(1/d))$ approaches $\pi$ from below as $d$ increases.  This
means that, for sufficiently large $d$, the upper bound in the
following lemma only holds for $\alpha < \pi+\epsilon$.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{dd-b}
If $\alpha < 2(\pi-\arccos(1/d))$ then $f^d_\alpha(n) \le \ceil{n/(d+1)}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} 
We use a generalization of the point set used in the proof of
\lemref{b}.  Let $T$ be a regular $d$-simplex whose center is at the
origin and consider the $d+1$ rays originating at the origin and each
containing a different vertex of $T$.  On each of these rays, place
$\ceil{n/(d+1)}$ or $\floor{n/(d+1)}$ points, as appropriate, to
produce a point set $S$ of size $n$.  We claim, as in the proof
of \lemref{b}, that for any point $p\in\R^2$, there is a
$2\arccos(1/d)$-wedge that contains $p$ and $d$ of the $d+1$ rays that
contain the points of $S$. 

To see why this is so, let $C_1,\ldots,C_{d+1}$ be the closed cones
obtained by taking the affine hull of each face of $T$.  Notice that
these cones cover $\R^d$ and that each cone contains $d$ of
the $d+1$ rays that contain $S$.  Furthermore, if the cone $C_i$
contains the point $-p$ then, by \lemref{cone-angle}, there is a
$2\arccos(1/d)$-wedge whose apex is at $p$ and that contains $C_i$.  

If we consider the complementary $2(\pi-\arccos(1/d))$-wedge then the
interior of this wedge does not intersect $C_i$ and hence intersects
only 1 of the $d+1$ rays that contain $S$. This
$2(\pi-\arccos(1/d))$-wedge contains an $\alpha$-wedge that contains $p$
and contains at most $\ceil{n/(d+1)}$ points of $S$, as required.
\end{proof}

Next we consider lower bounds.  The following lemma, which is a
generalization of a 3-dimensional result of Fekete and Meijer
\cite{fm00}
is used to find centerpoints.


\begin{lem}\lemlabel{weak-dd}
If $\alpha \ge \pi+2\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})$ then $f_\alpha^d(n)\ge \ceil{n/2}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $h_1,\ldots,h_d$ be any $d$ orthogonal halving hyperplanes of $S$
and let the point $p$ be the point common to $h_1,\ldots,h_d$ .
Consider any $\alpha$-wedge whose apex is $p$ and suppose that the
axis of this wedge is the ray $r$.  We claim that one of the planes
$h_i$ makes an angle of at least $\pi/2-\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})$ with $r$.
To see this, observe that the (positive and negative) normal vectors
of the halving planes are a set of $2d$ points on the unit sphere in
$\R^d$.  In fact, they are the vertices of generalized
octahedron. Placing spherical caps of radius $\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})$
gives a covering of the sphere, and hence $r$ forms an angle of at
most $\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})$ with at least one of the normals.
Therefore, $r$ forms an angle of at least $\pi/2-\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})$
with the corresponding halving plane $h_i$.

Therefore, the $\alpha$-wedge with axis $r$ contains $h_i$ and so
contains one of the two halfspaces bounded by $h_i$.  Since this is
true for any $\alpha$-wedge containing $p$ we conclude that
$D_\alpha(p,S)\ge\ceil{n/2}$, as required.  
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{ddim}
The function $f_\alpha^d$ satisfies
\[\begin{array}{rcll}
  f^d_\alpha(n) & = & 1 & \mbox{if $\alpha < \pi$} \\
  f^d_\alpha(n) & = & \ceil{n/(d+1)} & \mbox{if $\pi\le \alpha <
2(\pi-\arccos(1/d))$} \\
\ceil{n/2}\ge  f^d_\alpha(n) & \ge & \ceil{n/(d+1)} & \mbox{if
$2(\pi-\arccos(1/d)) \le \alpha \le \pi+2\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})$ } \\
  f^d_\alpha(n) & = & \ceil{n/2} & \mbox{if
$\pi+2\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})\le \alpha < 2\pi$} \\
\end{array}\]
\end{thm}

Notice that, as $d\rightarrow\infty$, $2(\pi-\arccos(1/d))\rightarrow
\pi$ and $\pi+\arccos(1/\sqrt{d})\rightarrow 2\pi$.  Thus,
\thmref{ddim} leaves a considerable gap in our knowledge.


\section{Some Results for $\R^3$}
\seclabel{3d}

Since we have been unable to fully determine $f^d_\alpha$ for all
values of $d$, we concentrate our efforts in this section on the
special case $d=3$.  We begin by restating \thmref{ddim} with $d=3$.

\newcommand{\degrees}{^\circ}

\begin{cor}
The function $f_\alpha^3$ satisfies
\[\begin{array}{rcll}
  f^3_\alpha(n) & = & 1 & \mbox{if $\alpha < 180\degrees$} \\
  f^3_\alpha(n) & = & \ceil{n/4} & 
    \mbox{if $180\degrees \le \alpha < 218.94\degrees$} \\
\ceil{n/2}\ge  f^3_\alpha(n) & \ge & \ceil{n/4} & 
    \mbox{if $218.95\degrees \le \alpha \le 289.47\degrees$ } \\
  f^3_\alpha(n) & = & \ceil{n/2} & 
    \mbox{if $289.48\degrees\le \alpha < 360\degrees$} \\
\end{array}\]
\end{cor}





We first show that the situation is more complex in $\R^3$
than in $\R^2$.  That is, the function $f_\alpha^3$ does not
change immediately from $\ceil{n/4}$ to $\ceil{n/2}$ at the threshold
value $\alpha=2(\pi-\arccos(1/3))$.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{dd-bb}
If $\alpha < 2(\pi-\arccos(1/\sqrt{5}))$ ($\alpha < 233.13\degrees$) then $f^3_\alpha(n) \le 2\ceil{n/5}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Hardin, Sloane and Smith \cite{hssXX} describe a covering of the unit
sphere by 5 spherical caps whose angular radius is
$\arccos(1/\sqrt{5})$.  Let the centers of these 5 caps be denoted by
$v_1,\ldots,v_5$. (These are the vertices of a regular triangular
bipyramid.) For the lower bound point set, we place $\ceil{n/5}$ or
$\floor{n/5}$ points on each of the 5 rays from the origin through
$v_1,\ldots,v_5$. 

The convex hull of $v_1,\ldots,v_5$ has 6 equilateral triangular
faces.  In particular, none of the faces are obtuse.  Thus, in each
face there is a point whose radial projection onto the unit sphere is
contained in three of the spherical caps. States another way, for each
face $f$, there is a $2\arccos(1/\sqrt{5})$-wedge with apex at the
origin that contains $f$.

At this point, the remainder of the proof is exactly as in the proof
of \lemref{dd-b}.  Take the affine hull of each face of the convex
hull, and determine some affine hull $h$ that contains $-p$.  Then
there is a $2\arccos(1/\sqrt{5})$-wedge with apex at $p$ and that
contains $h$ so therefore contains at least $3\floor{n/5}$ points of
$S$.  The complementary $(2\pi-2\arccos(1/\sqrt{5}))$-wedge contains
an $\alpha$-wedge that contains $p$ and at most $n-3\floor{n/5}\le
2\ceil{n/5}$ points of $S$ so $D_\alpha(p,S)\le 2\ceil{n/5}$, as
required.  
\end{proof}

Next we give an improvement on the value of $\alpha$ required to
achieve $f_\alpha^3(n)\ge\ceil{n/2}$.

\begin{lem} 
If $\alpha\ge 3\pi/2$ ($\alpha\ge 270\degrees$) then $f_\alpha^3(n)\ge
\ceil{n/2}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Fekete and Meijer \cite{fm00} show that, for every set $S$ of $n$
points in $\R^3$, there exists 3 mutually orthogonal
halving planes of $S$ that partition $\R^3$ into 8 octants such that the
number of points in opposite octants is equal.  If we take $p$ to be
the common intersection point of these 3 halving planes and let $w$ be
any $\alpha$-wedge that contains $p$ then we find that, if some octant
$Q$ is not entirely contained in $w$ then the octant $-Q$ is entirely
contained in $w$.  (This is because for any $q\in Q$ and $r\in-Q$,
$\angle qOr\ge \pi/2$.) Thus, for every point of $S$ not in $w$ there
is a point of $S$ that is in $w$, so $D_\alpha(p,S)\ge \ceil{n/2}$, as
required. 
\end{proof}


\comment{
 
\begin{lem}
If $\alpha > \pi+2\arccos(\sqrt{3/7}))$ ($\alpha>278.22\degrees$) then $f^3_\alpha(n) \le \ceil{n/2}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Consider the four vectors: 
\[
   V=\left\{v_1=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right] ,
   v_2=\left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] ,
   v_3=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 \\ 1/2 \end{array}\right] ,
   v_4=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 \\ -1/2 \end{array}\right] 
  \right\}
  \enspace .
\]
Observe that if we rotate these points by an angle of $\pi$ about the
$x$-axis we obtain the vectors 
\[
   v_1'=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{array}\right] = -v_1,\,
   v_2'=\left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] = v_2,\,
   v_3'=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ -\sqrt{3}/2 \\ -1/2
\end{array}\right] = -v_3,\,
   v_4'=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ -\sqrt{3}/2 \\ 1/2
\end{array}\right] = -v_4 \enspace .
\]

Thus, if we start with the 4 halving planes $P_1,\ldots,P_4$ of $S$
such that the outer normal of $P_i$ is $v_i$, for
$i\in\{1,\ldots,4\}$, and rotate $v_1,\ldots,v_4$ continuously about the
$x$-axis, while maintaining the invariant that the $P_i$s are halving
planes perpendicular to the $v_i$s then we go from a situation in
which $P_2\cap P_3\cap P_4$ is to the right (respectively, left) of
$P_1$ to a situation in which $P_2\cap P_3\cap P_4$ is to the left
(respectively, right) of $P_1$.  We conclude that at some point during
the rotation all $P_1,\ldots,P_4$ were concurrent.

Thus, by a rotation we may assume, wlog, that there are four
concurrent halving planes $h_1,\ldots,h_4$ whose innner and outer
normals come from the set $V\cup -V$.  Let $p$ be the common
intersection point of these these four planes and consider any
$\alpha$-wedge with apex at $p$ and axis $r$.  Then it is easy to
verify that $r$ makes an angle of at most $\arccos(\sqrt{3/7})$ with
at least one of the normals.  Thus, this $\alpha$-wedge contains the
corresponding halving plane and at least $\ceil{n/2}$ points of $S$,
as required.
\end{proof}

\comment{
\noindent\textbf{Remark:} The proof of the above lemma uses the
existence of 4 concurrent halving planes whose inner and outer normals
form the vertices of a regular six-sided bipyramid.  If, instead, we
were able to show the existence of 6 concurrent halving planes whose
inner and outer normals formed the vertices of an icosahedron, the
bound on alpha would be $\alpha$

The following theorem summarizes the above results.

\begin{thm}
The function $f_\alpha^3$ satisfies
\[\begin{array}{rcll}
  f^3_\alpha(n) & = & 1 & \mbox{if $\alpha < 180\degrees$} \\
  f^3_\alpha(n) & = & \ceil{n/4} & 
    \mbox{if $180\degrees \le \alpha < 218.94\degrees$} \\
\ceil{2n/5}\ge  f^3_\alpha(n) & \ge & \ceil{n/4} & 
    \mbox{if $218.95\degrees \le \alpha \le 233.18\degrees$ } \\
\ceil{n/2}\ge  f^3_\alpha(n) & \ge & \ceil{n/4} & 
    \mbox{if $233.19\degrees \le \alpha \le 270.00\degrees$ } \\
  f^3_\alpha(n) & = & \ceil{n/2} & 
    \mbox{if $270.00\degrees\le \alpha < 360.00\degrees$} \\
\end{array}\]
\end{thm}




\comment{

\begin{lem}
Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in $\R^3$ and let
$V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_4\}$ be a set of 4 vectors in $\R^3$ with
the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\rho(v_1)=-v_1$ and 
\item $v_1\in\rho(V)\cup -\rho(V)$, for $i\in\{1,\ldots,4\}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}





\begin{lem}
Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in $\R^3$.  Then there exists
$4$ concurrent halving hyperplanes of $S$ that are parallel to the
sides a regular tetrahedron.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
The columns of the following matrix are the coordinates of the
vertices of a regular tetrahedron.

\[T=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
  \sqrt{6} & \sqrt{6} & -2\sqrt{6} & 0 \\
  \sqrt{3} & \sqrt{3} & \sqrt{3} & -3\sqrt{3} \\
  3\sqrt{2} & -3\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0
\end{array} \right]
\]
Suppose we wish to 
rotate
the vertices of $T$ about the $z$-axis by an angle of $\theta$.
This is accomplished by computing 
$R_\theta T$, where $R_\theta$ is the rotation
matrix
\[R_\theta=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
   \cos(\theta)  & -\sin(\theta)  & 0 \\
   \sin(\theta)  & \cos(\theta)   & 0 \\
   0           & 0           & 1  
\end{array}\right]\]
In particular, if we set $\theta=\pi$ then we obtain
\[R_\pi T=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
  -\sqrt{6} & -\sqrt{6} & 2\sqrt{6} & 0 \\
  -\sqrt{3} & -\sqrt{3} & -\sqrt{3} & 3\sqrt{3} \\
  3\sqrt{2} & -3\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0
\end{array} \right]
\]
Remarkably, the set of vectors we obtain in this way is the reflection
of the original set of vectors.  That is, if we treat $T$ as a set of
column vectors then $R_\theta T=-T$ because $R_\theta v_1=-v2$,
$R_\theta v_2=-v_1$, $R_\theta v_3=-v_3$ and $R_\theta v_4=-v_4$.
(This does not seem to generalize to $d$ dimensions for any $d>3$.)
\end{proof}


Notice that the threshold value for $\alpha$ in the above lemma
approaches $2\pi$ from below as $d$ gets large, so for sufficiently
large $d$, the bound only holds for $\alpha \ge 2\pi -\epsilon$.

Putting everything together, we get the picture so far:

\begin{tabular}{l|cc}
$d$ & Upper bound of $\ceil{n/(d+1)}$ & Lower bound of $\ceil{n/2}$ \\
\hline
2 & $\alpha < 240.00$ & $\alpha \ge 240.00$ \\
3 & $\alpha < 218.94$ & $\alpha \ge 289.47$ \\
4 & $\alpha < 208.96$ & $\alpha \ge ??$ \\
5 & $\alpha < 203.07$ & $\alpha \ge ??$ \\
6 & $\alpha < 199.19$ & $\alpha \ge ??$ \\
\end{tabular}
}





\section{Conclusions}
\seclabel{conclusions}

We have completely determined the function $f^2_\alpha$ and given a
linear-time algorithm for finding a point $p$ such that
$D_\alpha(p,S)\ge f^2_\alpha(|S|)$.  
Our main new algorithmic result is a linear-time algorithm for finding
3 concurrent halving lines, each pair of which forms an angle of
$\pi/3$.  These triples of halving lines were used by Fekete and
Meijer \cite{fm00}
to show that the cost of a minimum Steiner star of an $n$ point
set in $\R^2$ is at most $2/\sqrt{3}$ times the cost of the
maximum matching of the same set.  Our algorithm gives an $O(n)$ time
construction of a Steiner star matching this bound.  

Fekete and Meijer also prove that, in $\R^3$, the ratio
between the minimum Steiner star and the maximum matching is at most
$\sqrt{2}$ by showing the existence of 3 orthogonal halving planes
with the property that the number of points in opposite orthants is
equal.  They prove this by taking an arbitrary halving plane $\Pi$,
projecting the points onto $\Pi$, and finding two orthogonal halving
lines in $\Pi$ such that opposite quadrants have the same number of
projected points above and below $\Pi$. The existence of these two
halving lines is guaranteed by a simple continuity argument.   A
(simpler) variant of the algorithm from \lemref{construction} can be
used to find these two orthogonal halving lines and hence find three
orthogonal halving planes in $O(n)$ time.  Again, this gives an $O(n)$
time algorithm to construct the Steiner star achieving this bound.


We conclude with a list of open problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a point set $S$ in $\R^2$, what is the complexity
of finding a point $p\in\R^2$ that maximizes $D_\alpha(p,S)$?
For $\alpha=\pi$, i.e., halfplane depth, Chan has recently given an
$O(n\log n)$ time algorithm \cite{c04}.

\item Our understanding of the function $f^d_\alpha$ is still
incomplete for $d\ge 3$.

\item In $\R^2$, we are able to find 3 concurrent halving
lines whose sides are parallel to the edges of an equilateral
triangle.  The same technique can be used in $\R^d$, if $d$ is
even, to show that there always exists $d+1$ concurrent halving
hyperplanes whose sides are parallel to the edges of a regular
$d$-simplex. (The proof involves continuously rotating the
$d$-simplex until each of its vertices has been reflected through the
origin; this works in even dimensions because reflection through the
origin can be implemented as a sequence of rotations.)
A different proof can be used to prove the same result for
$\R^3$.  Does this result hold in $\R^d$ for all
values of $d$?

\item In $\R^2$ any pair of orthogonal halving lines partitions
the plane into four quadrants such that the number of points in
opposite quadrants is equal. In $\R^3$, Fekete and Meijer
\cite{fm00} showed the existence of 3 orthogonal halving planes with the same
property.  This raises the following question: Given a set $S$ of $n$
points in $\R^d$ is it the case that we can always find an
arrangement of $d$ mutually orthogonal halving hyperplanes of $S$ such
that cells with opposite sign vectors in the arrangement contain the
same number of points of $S$?

\item Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in $\R^d$, for $d\ge 3$,
what is the complexity of finding a point $p\in \R^d$ such
that $p\ge f_\alpha^d(n)$?  This problem is still open even for the
case $\alpha=\pi$, though the algorithm of Jadhav and Mukhopadhyay
\cite{jm94} settles the problem for $d=2$ and $\alpha=\pi$. 

\item In this paper we have only considered $\alpha$-wedges.  This is
mainly because, for $d=2$, these are more or less the only interesting
scale-invariant objects.  However, in higher dimensions, one can
define many scale-invariant shapes.  In general, for any shape $F$,
one can study the properties of $F$-depth:
\[
  D_F(p,S) = \min\left\{ 
     h\cap S : \mbox{$h$ is an $F$ that contains $p$}
  \right\} \enspace .
\] 
\end{enumerate}
