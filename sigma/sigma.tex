\begin{lem}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with with $n$ vertices and $m\le n^{4/3}$
edges and let $V'\subseteq V$ be obtained by sampling each vertex of
$V$ independently with probability $k/n^{1/3}$.  Then, 
\[
    \Pr\left\{\sum_{v\in V'}\deg(v) \ge kn\log n \right\} 
       		\le n^{-\Omega(c)}\log n
\]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The proof uses the following (extremely weak) version of Chernoff's
bounds \cite{c52}:  For a binomial random variable $B$, 
\[  
     \Pr\{ B \ge (1+\E[B])c\log n \} \le n^{-\Omega(c)}  \enspace .
\]
Let $V^{i}=\{ v\in V \mid 2^i \le \deg(v) \le 2^{i+1}\}$.  By the
version of Chernoff's bound above,
\[
   \Pr\{ |V^{i}\cap V'| \ge (1+|V^{i}|k/n^{1/3})c\log n \} \le
n^{-\Omega(c)} \enspace .
\]
Therefore, with probablity at least $1-n^{\Omega(c)}\log n$
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \sum_{v\in V'} \deg(v)  
     & = & \sum_{i=0}^{\log n}\sum_{v\in V'\cap V^i} \deg(v) \\
     & \le & \sum_{i=0}^{\log n}2^i|V'\cap V^i| \\
     & \le & \sum_{i=0}^{\log n}2^i(1+|V^{i}|k/n^{1/3})c\log n \\
     & \le & 2cn\log n + \sum_{i=0}^{\log n}i(2^i|V^{i}|kc\log n) /n^{1/3} \\
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $m\ge cn^{4/3}$ edges
and let $V'\subseteq V$ be obtained by sampling each vertex of
$V$ independently with probability $k/n^{1/3}$.  Then, 
\[
    \Pr\left\{\sum_{v\in V'}\deg(v) \le kn\log n \right\} 
       		= n^{-\Omega(c)}
\]
\end{lem}

Let $\sigma$ be a value such that $G_\sigma(S)=(S,E)$ has $n^{4/3}$ edges.
Let $S_<$ be the vertices of $G_\sigma$ that have degree less than
$n^{4/3}/2$ and let $S_\ge=S\setminus S_<$.  Then we have
\[
     \sum_{v\in S_<}\deg(v) \le n^{4/3}/2
\]
so
\[
     \sum_{v\in S_\ge}\deg(v) \ge n^{4/3}/2 \enspace .
\]
This means that if we want to know approximately the number of edges
in $G_\sigma$ it suffices to sum up the degrees of the vertices in
$S_\ge$.  Note that, since the degree of any vertex is at most $n$,
\[
        |S_\ge| \ge n^{1/3}/2 \enspace .
\]
This means there are a lot of high degree vertices.

Now, if we take a random sample $S'$ of $cn^{2/3}\log^2 n$ vertices from $S$,
then, with probability very close to 1
\[
      (1-\epsilon)|S_\ge|\frac{\log^2 n}{n^{1/3}} 
	\le |S'\cap S_\ge| 
	\ge (1+\epsilon)|S_\ge|\frac{\log^2 n}{n^{1/3}} \enspace .
\]
Actually, it's even stronger than this.  Let $S^{i}_\le$ be the number
of vertices of $S'$
