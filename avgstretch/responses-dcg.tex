\begin{verbatim}
1. page 7, para -3, line 2: Replace (4\sqrt{d} + 2)^d by (2\sqrt{d} + 2)^d.
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
2. page 10, para 2: Replace "smallest index" by "largest index", "infinity" by
"minus infinity", and "minimizes" by "maximizes".
\end{verbatim}

We didn't change this. Rather, we changed an earlier paragraph so that $\Delta_1,...,\Delta_{n'}$ are ordered by increasing (rather than decreasing) size.  That fixes this paragraph, and introduces changes in a few other parts of the paper that depend use the fact that (now) $r_i \ge r_j$ if $i \ge j$.

\begin{verbatim}
3. page 14, para 1, line : "... of radius at most $(c+2) 2^{t+1}$."

Replace by "... of radius at most $(c+1) 2^{t+1}$."
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
4. page 14, para 2, line 5: "... is at least $4 c^d$ times ..."

Replace $4 c^d$ by $2 c^2$.
\end{verbatim}

Done. 

\begin{verbatim}
5. page 16, para 2: You use t and C here, but they have not yet been defined.
\end{verbatim}

As far as we can tell, the first use of $t$ and $C$ are in paragraph 3, which starts with the sentence
``To begin, we fix some positive integers $C \in O(1)$ and $t < \ell - C$ to be specified later.'' so we have left this unchanged. 

\begin{verbatim}
6. page 16, para 2, line 3: "... contain many of points of V ..."
Delete "of"
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
7. page 17, Caption of Figure 9: Replace $\Delta_{i_{j^*}}$ by $\Delta_{i_{j^*+1}}$.
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
8. page 18, top: In the first inequality on this page for $\epsilon$,
replace D by sqrt{D}.
\end{verbatim}

We decided to skip this unnecessary intermediate step and immediately set $t=D/\epsilon$ and $\epsilon >= D^{2/3}(k/n)^{1/3}$.

\begin{verbatim}
9. page 18, lines -3 and -4: Divide all distances and radii by c (three occurrences).
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
10. page 19, line 1: "... define at least one pair ..."

Replace by "... define at least one bad pair ..."
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
11. page 19, line 7: Replace $E_{i'} \subset E_{i_{j^*+t+C}}$
by $E_{i'} \subset E'_{i_{j^*+t+C}}$.
\end{verbatim}


Done.

\begin{verbatim}
12. page 19, line 8: "Since $E_{i'}$ and $E_{i_{j^*}}$ are disjoint
and $E_{i'} \subset E_{i_{j^*+t+C}}$, ..."

Replace by: "Since $E_{i'}$ and $E'_{i_{j^*}}$ are disjoint
and $E_{i'} \subset E'_{i_{j^*+t+C}}$ ..."
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
13. page 19, line 9: "|V \cap E_{i_{j^*+t+C}} \setminus E_{i_{j^*}}| \ge ..."

Replace by "|V \cap E'_{i_{j^*+t+C}} \setminus E'_{i_{j^*}}| \ge ..."
\end{verbatim}

Done.

\begin{verbatim}
14. page 19, line 11: "|V \cap E_{i_{j^*+t+2 \mu}} \setminus E_i| \in ..."

Replace by "|V \cap E'_{i_{j^*+t+C}} \setminus E'_{i_{j^*}}| \in ..."
\end{verbatim}

Done

\begin{verbatim}
15. page 26, middle: "... a straightforward minimization argument shows that ...
\ge \frac{\sqrt{\alpha n} + n / \sqrt{2} - O(n^{1/4})}{n / \sqrt{2}} ..."

The numerator in this expression is incorrect. (However, the numerator is indeed
$n/\sqrt{2} + \Omega(\sqrt{\alpha n})$, so the lower bound on the average
stretch factor derived is correct as stated.)
\end{verbatim}

We have corrected this.
