%%%                        For static collections of text, such as

%%%                        the reader's attention is drawn to the
%%%                        important breakthroughs represented by the
%%%                        work of E. Fox and collaborators
%%%                        (1988--1992), which now permit derivation
%%%                        of hash functions for collections of
%%%                        millions of keys, instead of at most a few
%%%                        hundred with the methods of earlier work.

%%%                        Witten, Moffat, and Bell (Witten:1994:MGC)
%%%                        describe very recent work on minimal
%%%                        ordered perfect hash functions, that is,
%%%                        ones in which entries are stored in some
%%%                        predefined order, such as alphabetical;
%%%                        this makes enumeration of a sorted key list
%%%                        trivial.  The methods of their book are
%%%                        implemented in software (retrievable on the
%%%                        Internet) for solving the full text search
%%%                        problem: given a word, or word, find all
%%%                        documents in a large collection that
%%%                        contain that word.  Their software also
%%%                        supports Boolean search (find A and B or C
%%%                        and not D), and query ranked search (given
%%%                        a list of several words, find documents
%%%                        containing them, and rank them by the
%%%                        number of matches).

%%%                        These references have been extracted from a

%%%                        collection on ftp.ira.uka.de in
%%%                        /pub/bibliography to which many people of
%%%                        have contributed.  The snapshot of this
%%%                        collection was taken on 5-May-1994, and it
%%%                        consists of 441 BibTeX files, 2,672,675
%%%                        lines, 205,289 entries, and 6,375
%%%                        <at>String{} abbreviations, occupying 94.8MB
%%%                        of disk space.
%%%
%%%                        At version 0.34, about 65 new entries were
%%%                        added from a search of the OCLC Article1st
%%%                        database, and another 60 existing entries
%%%                        were updated with new information.  At version
%%%                        0.37, another 46 entries were added from a
%%%                        search of the OCLC Proceedings database.
%%%
%%%                        At version 0.56, a search of the Compendex
%%%                        databases (1970--1996) added 185 new
%%%                        entries, and provided additional data
%%%                        for many other entries.
%%%
%%%                        Regrettably, the quality of many of those
%%%                        bibliography files is low, with incomplete
%%%                        bibliographic data (missing author
%%%                        initials, page numbers, titles, proceedings
%%%                        cross-references, ....) and spelling and
%%%                        typing errors.  Also, because the
%%%                        collection came from many sources, there is
%%%                        much duplication, and I had to spend much
%%%                        longer than I expected identifying
%%%                        duplicates, and merging them manually into
%%%                        single entries with maximal bibliographic
%%%                        information.
%%%
%%%                        I have corrected all spelling errors that I
%%%                        could identify with the help of two
%%%                        separate spelling programs, though this is
%%%                        difficult with multi-lingual text.  The
%%%                        list of spelling exceptions (i.e. words
%%%                        believed to be correctly spelled, but
%%%                        absent from the spelling program
%%%                        dictionaries) is kept in the companion file
%%%                        with extension .sok.

%%%                        I have supplied publisher, ISBN, LCCN, page
%%%                        number data to the extent possible with the
%%%                        resources of the U.S. Library of Congress
%%%                        catalog, and other university catalogs
%%%                        accessible on the Internet, particularly
%%%                        the University of California MELVYL
%%%                        catalog, and the Stanford University RLIN
%%%                        catalog (thanks to the willow software from
%%%                        the University of Washington).  Their
%%%                        availability is gratefully acknowledged.

%%%                        For books published since 1972, when the
%%%                        International Standard Book Numbering
%%%                        system was introduced, ISBNs are
%%%                        particularly important, because they are
%%%                        unique numbers that identify the country
%%%                        group, publisher, and book; bookstores
%%%                        routinely request ISBNs from their
%%%                        customers.
%%%
%%%                        Journal, organization, and publisher names,
%%%                        and publisher addresses, have all been
%%%                        replaced by consistent abbreviations of the
%%%                        form j-xyz, org-xyz, pub-xyz, and
%%%                        pub-xyz:adr.  The variation in spelling and
%%%                        abbreviation in the original data was
%%%                        distressingly large.
%%%
%%%                        LCCN (Library of Congress Call Numbers) are
%%%                        given wherever applicable, because they are
%%%                        widely used by libraries in the United
%%%                        States and possibly elsewhere.  Please note
%%%                        that these are letter-digit-year
%%%                        combinations like QA76.9.D35 D48 1986,
%%%                        rather than the field LCCN: 85-26850 r91
%%%                        which appears in Library of Congress
%%%                        catalog entries, and is an internal number
%%%                        of apparent little use elsewhere.
%%%
%%%                        More than 235 of these references are
%%%                        papers in conference proceedings, and
%%%                        regrettably, for about 30 of them, I have
%%%                        been unable to locate an exact reference to
%%%                        the conference volume in the various
%%%                        on-line library catalogs that I consulted.
%%%                        This is disappointing, because it suggests
%%%                        that the papers will be largely
%%%                        inaccessible.
%%%
%%%                        Missing data are indicated throughout by

%%%                        I will be very grateful to users of this

%%%                        well as for new entries.  Despite the very
%%%                        large collection from which this data was
%%%                        extracted, more than half of the papers in

                 coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is
                 that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for
                 membership in a given set of messages. Two new
                 hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a
                 particular conventional hash-coding method. The
                 computational factors considered are the size of the
                 hash area (space), the time required to identify a
                 message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time),
                 and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are
                 intended to reduce the amount of space required to
                 contain the hash-coded information from that associated
                 with conventional methods. The reduction in space is
                 accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small
                 fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in

                 memory hierarchy. The first storage level, which is the
                 fast store, is divided into a number of storage areas.
                 When an entry is to be filed in the hierarchy, a
                 hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry into
                 one of these areas. If this particular area is full,
                 then the entry will be placed into the slower
                 second-level store, even though other areas in the
                 first-level store may have space available. Given that
                 N entries have been filed in the entire hierarchy, an
                 expression is derived for the expected number of
                 entries filed in the first-level store. This expression

                 store is being used. By means of examples, storage
                 utilization is then studied as a function of the

                 a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered.
                 Moreover, it can be used to eliminate previously
                 flagged deletions from any hash-coded table, or to
                 change from one hashing method to another. The

                 the event of successive collisions, exactly (n plus
                 1)/2 different entries are eventually examined
                 (although more than (n plus 1)/2 probes may be
                 necessary to achieve this). If n is a power of 2 then
                 in general only a small portion of the table will be
                 searched. Two sets of quadratic polynomials are
                 presented here which guarantee full period search (n
                 different entries hit in n probes) for any table size
                 which is a power of 2. It is also proved that these are
                 the only quadratic polynomials with this property.",

                 The better-known methods of calculating hash addresses
                 and of handling collisions and bucket overflow are
                 presented and compared. It is shown that under certain

                 to a certain class will have the same hash code, thus
                 providing an improvement over the usual notion of a
                 hash code as a randomizing technique. Several

                 deletion without key relocations. It makes use of
                 parallelism of memory access and can be realized by
                 conventional multi-bank memory with additional logic
                 circuitry. Three parallel hash algorithms to be
                 implemented in the hardware are described and their
                 efficiencies are compared. The amount of additional
                 logic varies, depending upon the algorithm to be used
                 and upon a scheme for handling inactive key positions.
                 The result of the analysis shows that basic hash
                 operations can be performed in the time comparable to
                 single indirect addressing.",

                 item in a static table with a single probe is
                 considered. Given a set I of identifiers, two methods
                 are presented for building, in a mechanical way,
                 perfect hashing functions, i.e. functions transforming
                 the elements of I into unique addresses. The first
                 method, the ``quotient reduction'' method, is shown to
                 be complete in the sense that for every set I the
                 smallest table in which the elements of I can be stored
                 and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect
                 hashing function constructed by this method can be
                 found. However, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this
                 method can give rather sparse tables. The second
                 method, the ``remainder reduction'' method, is not
                 complete in the above sense, but it seems to give
                 minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of
                 set. The two techniques are applicable directly to
                 small sets. Some methods to extend these results to
                 larger sets are also presented. A rough comparison with
                 ordinary hashing is given which shows that this method
                 can be used conveniently in several practical

  abstract =     "The performance of hashing algorithms is related to
                 the notion of clustering, that is, the pile-up
                 phenomenon that occurs because many keys may probe the
                 table locations in the same sequence. A hashing
                 technique is said to exhibit k-ary clustering if the
                 search for a key begins with k independent random
                 probes and the subsequent sequence of probes is
                 completely determined by the location of the k initial
                 probes. Such techniques may be very bad; for instance,
                 the average number of probes necessary for insertion
                 may grow linearly with the table size. However, on the
                 average (that is if the permutations describing the
                 method are randomly chosen), k-ary clustering
                 techniques for k greater than 1 are very good. In fact
                 the average performance is asymptotically equivalent to
                 the performance of uniform probing, a method that
                 exhibits no clustering and is known to be optimal in a
                 certain sense.",

                 partial-match queries from a file containing a
                 collection of records, each record consisting of a
                 sequence of fields. A partial-match query is a
                 specification of values for zero or more fields of a
                 record, and the answer to a query is a listing of all
                 records in the file whose fields match the specified
                 values.\par A design is considered in which the file is
                 stored in a set of bins. A formula is derived for the
                 optimal number of bits in a bin address to assign to
                 each field, assuming the probability that a given field
                 is specified in a query is independent of what other
                 fields are specified. Implications of the optimality
                 criterion on the size of bins are also discussed.",

                 in limiting the search of a given key value in a file
                 is well known. Similarly, it is possible to avoid

                 Multiple-key hashing is a simple procedure for doing so
                 and works by combining the effects of a number of
                 hashing functions, one for each attribute in a record.
                 By using a measure of retrieval efficiency in which
                 queries specifying the same set of attributes are given
                 equal weight, it is shown that multiple-key hashing

                 with prototype strings stored in a dictionary, using

                 recently introduced principle of string comparison is
                 based on redundant hash addressing, and it is
                 computationally at least an order of magnitude lighter.
                 This method is here applied, using multiple prototypes
                 of phonemic strings for each word in the dictionary.
                 The matching criterion thereby applied in fact

                 functions with certain desirable properties, and
                 introduce two novel applications for hashing which make
                 use of these functions. One class contains a small
                 number of functions, yet is almost universal2. If the
                 functions hash n-bit long names into m-bit indices,
                 then specifying a member of the class requires only
                 O((m + log2 log2(n)) g log2(n)) bits as compared to
                 O(n) bits for earlier techniques. For long names, this
                 is about a factor of m larger than the lower bound of m
                 + log2n log2m bits. An application of this class is a
                 provably secure authentication technique for sending
                 messages over insecure lines. A second class of
                 functions satisfies a much stronger property than
                 universal2. We present the application of testing sets
                 for equality. The authentication technique allows the
                 receiver to be certain that a message is genuine. An
                 ``enemy'' even one with infinite computer resources
                 cannot forge or modify a message without detection. The
                 set equality technique allows operations including
                 ``add member to set,'' ``delete member from set,'' and
                 ``test two sets for equality'' to be performed in
                 expected constant time and with less than a specified
                 probability of error.",

                 the keys, the hash-bucket search method has many

                 expected to be? The approach taken differs from
                 traditional worst-case considerations, which consider
                 only the longest probe sequence of the worst possible
                 file instance. Three overflow handling schemes are
                 analysed: uniform hashing (random probing), linear
                 probing and separate chaining. The numerical results
                 show that the worst-case performance is expected to be

                 mathematical analysis of the expected performance of
                 the new scheme. The following performance measures are
                 considered: length of successful and unsuccessful
                 searches, accesses required to insert or delete a
                 record, and the size of the overflow area. The
                 performance is cyclical. For all performance measures,
                 the necessary formulas are derived for computing the
                 expected performance at any point of a cycle and the
                 average over a cycle. Furthermore, the expected worst
                 case in connection with searching is analyzed. The
                 overall performance depends on several file parameters.
                 The numerical results show that for many realistic
                 parameter combinations the performance is expected to

                 who intend to implement or further study the algorithm.
                 Techniques are developed for tuning an important
                 parameter that related the sizes of the address region
                 and the cellar in order to optimize the average running
                 times of different implementations. A value for the
                 parameter is reported that works well in most cases.
                 Detailed graphs explain how the parameter can be tuned
                 further to meet specific needs. The resulting tuned
                 algorithm outperforms several well-known methods
                 including standard coalesced hashing, separate (or
                 direct) chaining, linear probing, and double hashing. A
                 variety of related methods are also analyzed including

  abstract =     "In the data-flow model of computation instruction,
                 execution is determined by the availability of data
                 rather than by an explicit or implicit sequential flow
                 of control. One of the major problems in the
                 architectural design of a data-flow computer is the
                 detection of the availability of data. This problem is
                 compounded if the data carry context information as
                 well as pointers to the instructions that will use
                 them; an instruction is then executable when all data
                 directed to within the same context are presented. The
                 solution adopted in the Manchester design is to limit
                 the maximum number of operands of an instruction to
                 two, and to use associative storage techniques to
                 detect the presence of data. The use of true
                 content-addressable memory is precluded by its small
                 density and high cost, and therefore a
                 pseudo-associative store using hardware hashing
                 techniques and implemented with conventional
                 random-access memory is employed. The concept of
                 sequence in the data-flow model of computation is
                 unimportant; as a result search operations do not have
                 to be resolved in the same sequence that the store is
                 interrogated. This suggests a design which uses a main
                 parallel hash table and a separate overflow mechanism
                 operating in parallel. In this manner, an overflow
                 search need not halt the progress of further main hash
                 table searches. A pseudo-associative store results
                 whose average access time is close to the cycle time of
                 the original random-access memory.",

                 and a number of slave processors is via a star-shaped
                 network. The join algorithm uses hashing to segment
                 relation into N buckets and each bucket is assigned to
                 a slave processor. The segmented source relation is
                 first transmitted to the slave processors. Then the
                 segmented target relation is transmitted one tuple at a
                 time. All N slave processors execute the equi-join
                 operation in parallel upon receiving the target tuple
                 till all tuple of the target relation are transmitted.
                 The result relation is transmitted back to the master
                 processor. For general join the target relation buckets
                 are passed to the next neighbor in the ring. The
                 assignment of buckets to the slave processors ensures
                 the ordering based on the join. ---full review of this

                 Data Stream Processor (DSP), Data Stream Generator
                 (DSG), and Secondary Data Manager (SDM). Data stream is

                 hashing. Earlier analyses of uniform hashing are
                 extended here to multirecord buckets. Three different

                 nonuniform access frequencies, and the dynamic behavior
                 when insertions and deletions occur. Simple `closed'
                 formulas cannot be found, but numerical results are
                 readily computed. For larger bucket sizes the retrieval
                 performance is significantly better than that of linear

                 variants of both (i) providing random access to any
                 record of a file in close to one disk access and (ii)
                 having performance which does not vary with file size.

                 fixed and specifiable amount of main storage to achieve
                 this performance. Its underlying physical disk storage

                 the high performance of the Multidimensional Linear
                 Dynamic Hashing (MLDH) method. For example, for
                 uncontrolled splits, with b equals 5 and b prime equals
                 1, an average of 1.09 accesses is necessary,
                 irrespective of d (the dimension of the space), while
                 maintaining an average load factor of 0.67. On the
                 other hand, for controlled splits, even with a
                 threshold load factor of 0.9 for b equals 10, b prime
                 equals 2, we obtained an average number of accesses of
                 1.74. Storage mappings for these splitting strategies
                 were also developed, and as a byproduct we obtained a
                 quite general class of extendible array storage
                 mappings. We further intend to experiment with
                 different distributions of attribute values in real
                 files to see which splitting strategies are suitable.",

                 the performance of the scheme. Records in the file are

                 method, in which a portion of memory (called the
                 address region) serves as the range of the hash
                 function while the rest of memory (called the cellar)
                 is devoted solely to storing records that collide when
                 inserted. If the cellar should get full, subsequent
                 colliders must be stored in empty slots in the address
                 region and thus may cause later collisions. Varying the
                 relative size of the cellar affects search performance.
                 The main result of this paper expresses the average
                 search times as a function of the number of records and
                 the cellar size, solving a long-standing open problem.
                 These formulas are used to pick the cellar size that
                 leads to optimum search performance, and it is shown

                 well-known hashing schemes. A discussion of past work

                 fast for dynamic information storage and retrieval.
                 This study analyzes in a uniform way the performance of
                 coalesced hashing and its variants, thus settling some
                 open questions in the literature. In all the variants,
                 the range of the hash function is called the address
                 region, and extra space reserved for storing colliders
                 is called the cellar. The authors refer to the
                 unmodified method, which was analyzed previously, as
                 late-insertion coalesced hashing. In this work they
                 analyze late insertion and two new variations call
                 early insertion and varied insertion. When there is no
                 cellar, the early-insertion method is better than late
                 insertion; however, past experience has indicated that
                 it might be worse when there is a cellar. The analysis
                 confirms that it is worse. The varied-insertion method
                 was introduced as a means of combining the advantages
                 of late insertion and early insertion. This study shows
                 that varied insertion requires fewer probes per search,

                 (Multi-Version Structures) like arrays, hash-tables,
                 and sets in logic programming languages (i. e. Prolog).
                 One can define pure Prolog predicates which behave like
                 arrays etc., but the question is how efficient these
                 predicates are compared to the equivalent operations in
                 PASCAL, C or LISP. We discuss: (1) What kind of MVS we
                 want to have in Prolog. (2) The problems in
                 implementing them. (3) The alternative solutions. We
                 show how to implement arrays efficiently by introducing
                 multi-version arrays. Arrays which differ slightly from
                 each other are implemented using one physical array,
                 thus the cost of updating an array while retaining the
                 old array will be small. It is also possible to `go
                 back' to older versions and start modifying them
                 (without any damage to other versions). We show how to

                 overflow records from each primary bucket in one or

  abstract =     "A method is presented for identifying all directed
                 paths from the source to the sink (called `paths' in
                 this paper) in a directed acyclic network with one
                 source and one sink. Let L be the set of all the paths
                 in this network and N equals vertical L vertical. A
                 hash function is constructed having the following
                 properties: it is one-to-one and onto, the algorithms
                 to compute H and its inverse are linear in the number
                 of arcs in the network, it has the smallest possible
                 range and produces no collisions. All these properties
                 makes make it a very useful hash function in writing
                 computer programs which involve storing information
                 about all paths in the network. The techniques
                 described in this work can be used to construct has
                 functions for walks in cyclic graphs. An application to
                 simulation of stochastic networks is described and an
                 illustrative example is included.",

                 a very simple insertion procedure which, in comparison
                 to the standard approach, dramatically reduces the
                 variance of the number of probes required for a search.
                 This leads to a new search procedure that requires only
                 a constant number of probes, on average, even for full
                 tables. Finally, an extension to these methods yields a
                 new, simple way of performing deletions and subsequent
                 insertions. Experimental results strongly indicate

                 scarcity of different examples is a lack of experience

                 a distributed version of an extendable hash file, which

                 static sets stored in main memory. In this paper we

                 small in-core table and increased cost of insertions.
                 We also suggest a policy for limiting the cost of

                 cost of insertions under this policy. The results

                 is the same as conventional fixed-size hashing. When an
                 overflow or an underflow occurs, a bucket is split into
                 two or merged with another by maintaining a list of
                 overflow addresses. The overflow list, storing only the
                 addresses of buckets that experienced overflows, is
                 usually small enough to reside in the main memory, thus
                 the cost to retrieve a record is just one bucket
                 access. When the overflow list grows too big, the list
                 itself can be organized for rapid access using the same
                 hashing scheme recursively. It is also possible to

                 distance between overflow records overflowing from a

                 address, using a knowledge of the mean distance between

                 `addresses' will be integers from sets of consecutive
                 integers. A hashing function is said to be `perfect' or
                 `collision-free' if it is injective (1-1). If, in
                 addition, the function is surjective (onto), then it is
                 said to be `minimal. ' Two minimal perfect hashing
                 functions are presented. The first maps the 40 Modula-2
                 reserved words to the integers from 2 to 41, and the
                 second maps the 30 Modula-2 standard identifiers to the
                 integers from 3 to 32.",

                 workstations within an object-oriented environment.
                 Among the unique aspects of Gordion are: its ability to
                 communicate with multiple languages, introduction of
                 new concurrency control primitives, ability to
                 manipulate objects of arbitrary size, and object
                 sharing acorss the languages through a base set of
                 classes. The system is currently interfaced to two
                 languages, BiggerTalk and Zetalisp Flavors. Beside its
                 language interface, Gordin has an interface for the
                 system administrator, and an interface for debugging.
                 Major functional components of the system are:
                 concurrency control, storage, history and inquiry, and
                 maintenance. Concurrent access to objects is regulated
                 by four types of locks, and transactions encapsulate
                 units of work for the system. The storage systems uses
                 a hashing scheme and UNIX files to store objects. A

                 structures such as B** plus -trees and ISAM do provide
                 for sequential processing, but require considerable
                 storage for the indices. When sequential processing is
                 needed a table that performs an order-preserving
                 transformation on keys can be used. H is an
                 order-preserving key transform if H(K//1) greater than

                 bounded disorder method, is described. The method uses
                 a combination of hashing and tree indexing. The method
                 has good random access performance and is comparable to
                 the best hashing methods if its small index is stored
                 entirely in the main memory. The method's advantage
                 compared with hashing is that range searches are
                 possible while searching only a portion of the file
                 proportional to the size of the range. It is possible
                 to control index size by controlling node size. Node
                 size can be increased without increasing the amount of
                 data transferred during a random probe. Further,
                 increasing node size has only a minor effect on key
                 sequential access performance. Even quite large nodes,
                 so long as they can be read into memory in their
                 entirety, have good key sequential performance. The
                 bounded disorder method is the only method using large
                 nodes that can cope with arbitrary key distributions.
                 These properties make the bounded disorder method a
                 good choice as the only access method of a database

                 extends an earlier optimizer valiation and performance
                 evaluation of R* to distributed queries, i.e., single
                 SQL statements having tables at multiple sites. Actual
                 R* message, I/O and CPU resources consumed --- and the
                 corresponding costs estimated by the optimizer --- were
                 written to database tables using new SQL commands,
                 permitting automated control from application programs
                 for collecting, reducing, and comparing test data. A
                 number of tests were run over a wide variety of
                 dynamically-created test databases, SQL queries, and
                 system parameters. Both high-speed networks ---
                 comparable to a local area network --- and medium-speed
                 long-haul networks --- for linking geographically
                 dispersed hosts --- were evaluated. The tests confirmed
                 the accuracy of R*'s message cost model and the
                 significant contribution of local --- CPU and I/O ---
                 costs, even for a medium-speed network. Although
                 distributed queries consume more resources overall, the
                 response time for some execution strategies improves
                 disproportionately by exploiting both concurrency and
                 reduced contention for buffers. For distributed joins
                 in which a copy of the inner table must be transferred
                 to the join site, shipping the whole inner table
                 dominated the strategy of fetching only those inner
                 tuples that matched each outer-table value, even
                 though the former strategy may require additional
                 I/O. Bloom joins -hashed semijoins- consistently
                 performed better than semijoins and the best R*

                 it is usually assumed that the hash function
                 distributes the n keys randomly over the m table
                 positions. In this exact filling model, all the m**n
                 possible arrangements are equally likely. In some
                 cases, the analysis under this model becomes too
                 difficult, and a Poisson filling model is used instead.
                 It has been shown that a Poisson result can be
                 interpreted as a transform of the exact one, and this
                 transform can be inverted to recover the exact result,
                 and that the intuitive notion of using a Poisson result
                 to approximate the corresponding exact result can be
                 formalized, by means of an asymptotic expansion. A
                 stronger version of the approximation theorem, together

                 Today, when relational database systems are widely
                 populated, optimization of query evaluation procedures
                 is becoming even more important. Much more efficient

                 database organization must be tuned. This tutorial

                 for text and attributes. According to this method, the
                 documents (or records) are stored sequentially in one
                 file (``text file''), while abstractions of the
                 documents (``signatures'') are stored sequentially in
                 another file (``signature file''). In order to resolve
                 a query, the signature file is scanned first, and many

                 develop a framework that includes primary key hashing,
                 multiattribute hashing, and signature files. Our effort
                 is to find the optimal signature extraction method.
                 \par The main contribution of this paper is that we
                 present optimal and efficient suboptimal algorithms for
                 assigning words to signatures in several environments.
                 Another contribution is that we use information theory,
                 and study the relationship of the false drop
                 probability $F_d$ and the information that is lost
                 during signature extraction. We give tight lower bounds
                 on the achievable $F_d$ and show that a simple
                 relationship holds between the two quantities in the
                 case of optimal signature extraction with uniform
                 occurrence and query frequencies. We examine hashing as
                 a method to map words to signatures (instead of the
                 optimal way), and show that the same relationship holds
                 between $F_d$ and {\em loss}, indicating that an
                 invariant may exist between these two quantities for
                 every signature extraction method.",

                 sequential access to data. Central to the speed of the
                 method is the assumption that the entire index is
                 stored in main memory. Hashing is used to access data
                 in large, multibucket nodes, dramatically reducing the
                 index size for any given file size, and enabling a main
                 memory index to be achieved. The discussion covers
                 current data search methods; the bounded disorder
                 concept; the file structure used; handling of overflow;

                 maintaining a dynamic dictionary: items are inserted
                 and sought as usual in a separate-chaining hash table;
                 however, items that no longer need to be in the data
                 structure remain until a later insertion operation
                 stumbles on them and removes them from the table.
                 Because hashing with lazy deletion does not delete
                 items as soon as possible, it keeps more items in the
                 dictionary than methods that use more careful deletion
                 strategies. On the other hand, its space overhead is
                 much smaller than those more careful methods, so if the
                 number of extra items is not too large, hashing with
                 lazy deletion can be a practical algorithm when space

                 interconnected on a tree structured communication

                 leaf nodes. An average execution cost analysis is
                 presented for the multiple processor join methods. For
                 a reasonable ratio of result to operand cardinality,
                 joins which use hashing for semi-join of operands at

                 minimizes the number of comparisons needed to find an
                 item is the binary search. Unfortunately, the binary
                 search suffers from two defects that limit its
                 application. First, it requires that the table it is

  abstract =     "It is suggested that Gray codes be used to improve the
                 performance of methods for partial match and range
                 queries. Specifically, the author illustrates the
                 improved clustering of similar records that Gray codes
                 can achieve with multiattribute hashing. Gray codes are
                 used instead of binary codes to map record signatures
                 to buckets. In Gray codes, successive codewords differ
                 in the value of exactly one bit position; thus,
                 successive buckets hold records with similar record
                 signatures. The proposed method achieves better
                 clustering of similar records, thus reducing the I/O
                 time. A mathematical model is developed to derive
                 formulas giving the average performance of both
                 methods, and it is shown that the proposed method
                 achieves 0-50\% relative savings over the binary codes.
                 The author also discusses how Gray codes could be
                 applied to some retrieval methods designed for range
                 queries, such as the grid file and the approach based
                 on the so-called z-ordering. Gray codes are also used
                 to design good distance-preserving functions, which map
                 a k-dimensional (k-D) space into a one-dimensional one,
                 in such a way that points are close in the k-D space

                 is the gap between the ideal models that utilize shared
                 memory and the feasible models that consist of a
                 bounded-degree network of processors sharing no common
                 memory. This problem has been widely studied. Here a
                 tight bound for the probabilistic complexity of this
                 problem is established. The solution in this paper is
                 based on a probabilistic scheme for implementing shared
                 memory on a bounded-degree network of processors. This
                 scheme, which we term parallel hashing, enables $n$
                 processors to store and retrieve an arbitrary set of
                 $n$ data items in $O(\log n)$ parallel steps. The
                 items' locations are specified by a function chosen
                 randomly from a small class of universal hash
                 functions. A hash function in this class has a small
                 description and can therefore be efficiently
                 distributed among the processors. A deterministic lower
                 bound for the point-to-point communication model is
                 also presented.",

                 hashing schemes originally designed for external files.
                 This paper shows how to adapt these two methods for
                 hash tables stored in main memory. The necessary data
                 structures and algorithms are described, the expected
                 performance is analyzed mathematically, and actual
                 execution times are obtained and compared with
                 alternative techniques. Linear hashing is found to be
                 both faster and easier to implement than spiral
                 storage. Two alternative techniques are considered: a
                 simple unbalanced binary tree and double hashing with
                 periodic rehashing into a larger table. The retrieval
                 time of linear hashing is similar to double hashing and
                 substantially faster than a binary tree, except for
                 very small trees. The loading times of double hashing
                 (with periodic reorganization), a binary tree, and
                 linear hashing are similar. Overall, linear hashing is
                 a simple and efficient technique for applications where

                 access were originally needed, but now only efficient
                 direct access is needed. This is quite reasonable for a
                 database system which accommodates new and changing
                 applications. Several existing database systems, e. g.
                 INGRES, IMS and IDMS allow this type of reorganization,

                 analysis; we show how various protocols differ subtly
                 with respect to the required initial assumptions of the
                 participants and their final beliefs. Our formalism has
                 enabled us to isolate and express these differences
                 with a precision that was not previously possible. It
                 has drawn attention to features of protocols of which
                 we and their authors were previously unaware, and
                 allowed us to suggest improvements to the protocols.
                 The reasoning about some protocols has been
                 mechanically verified. This paper starts with an
                 informal account of the problem, goes on to explain the
                 formalism to be used, and gives examples of its
                 application to protocols from the literature, both with
                 conventional shared-key cryptography and with
                 public-key cryptography. Some of the examples are
                 chosen because of their practical importance, while
                 others serve to illustrate subtle points of the logic
                 and to explain how we use it. We discuss extensions of
                 the logic motivated by actual practice -- for example,
                 in order to account for the use of hash functions in
                 signatures. The final sections contain a formal
                 semantics of the logic and some conclusions.",

                 are CLV format discs such as CD ROM and WORM. In this
                 paper, we examine the issues related to the
                 implementation and performance of several different
                 file organizations on CLV format optical discs such as
                 CD ROM and WORM. The organizations examined are based
                 on hashing and trees. The CLV recording scheme is shown
                 to be a good environment for efficiently implementing
                 hashing. Single seek access and storage utilization
                 levels approaching 100\% can be achieved for CD ROM's.
                 It is shown that a B-tree organization is not a good
                 choice for WORM discs (both CAV and CLV), but a
                 modified ISAM approach can be appropriate for WORM
                 discs. We describe clustered BIM's, a class of tree
                 organizations appropriate for CD ROMS. Expressions for
                 the expected retrieval performance of both hashing and
                 trees are also given. The paper concludes by outlining
                 recent results and future directions on buffered
                 implementations of access methods for WORM discs, as
                 well as advantages of signature based access methods

                 is a perennial occupation of system designers and
                 algorithm implementors. However, for many problems, the
                 choice of a system makes much less difference that the
                 approach used to represent the problem. The mapping
                 from mathematics to a data representation and the
                 choice of algorithms can make significant, and
                 separate, contributions to efficiency. Systems which
                 have the flexibility to provide several data structures
                 and algorithms can provide an advantage in this
                 respect. Macsyma is probably the system with the
                 largest selection. On the other hand, Macsyma has not

                 for performing relational join. Here, the lower bound
                 implies only one disk access per joining block or page.
                 The first graph model is based on the block
                 connectivity of the joining relations. Using this
                 model, we considered the problem of determining an
                 ordered list of joining blocks that requires the
                 smallest size buffer. We have shown this problem as
                 well as the problem of computing the least upper bound
                 on the buffer size to be NP-hard. The second graph
                 model represents the page connectivity of the joining
                 relations. We have shown the problem of computing the
                 least upper bound on the buffer size for the page

                 ordered linked lists with heads defined as array of
                 pointers. Then the linked lists are merged in the
                 original array. For uniformly distributed lists and
                 careful choice of a hash function the algorithm works
                 quite efficiently and is faster than other sorting
                 methods. Our comparisons show that the algorithms works
                 more than twice as fast as Quick Sort. The disadvantage
                 with this method is that it needs extra space for 2N
                 records. Also it is not an in place sort. The algorithm
                 discussed in this paper improves on both these counts.
                 It uses less than N extra spaces on average. For
                 uniformly distributed keys extra space is less than
                 N/4. There are less than 2N record movement with this

                 parallelism from the match operation and can execute
                 the resulting parallel process efficiently. The amount
                 of parallelism extracted from the programs studied
                 ranges from 5.5 for the smallest to 21.8 for the
                 largest. A standard cell design of the CUPID processing

                 design is incorporated into the simulator. Measurements

  abstract =     "In this paper we present efficient join algorithms on
                 very large relations indexed by KD-trees. There are
                 previous works proposing the join on multi-attribute
                 clustered relations based on hashing and also on
                 grid-partitioning, whose shortcomings are non-order
                 preservation and low load-factor, respectively. KD-tree
                 indexed relations are characterized by preserving data
                 order and maintaining high load-factors. However,
                 KD-tree indexing has the disadvantage of generating
                 clusters which are overlapped in the join attribute
                 domain, what causes a very high I/O cost for naive join
                 algorithms. Here we analyze strategies to deal with
                 this problem and introduce efficient algorithms to join
                 two non-resident relations indexed by KD-trees. First
                 we introduce the concept of wave, which is a set of
                 pages that is the object of join processing and that
                 propagates over the relation space in the direction of
                 the join attribute axis. Based on this new concept, we
                 present five join algorithms and also four extended
                 algorithms with a garbage collection mechanism to
                 increase the effective space of the main memory. We
                 extensively evaluate these join algorithms with
                 analytical formulas and simulation results. It is shown
                 that the join of very large relations indexed by
                 KD-trees can be performed with one scan of the
                 relations.",

                 stochastically determine the number of unique labels
                 quickly and with a small amount of memory. This
                 technique is applicable to areas such as signal
                 processing, process monitoring and control, and
                 computer communication network monitoring and control.
                 The author focuses on the application of this technique
                 to congestion-avoidance algorithms in high-speed
                 computer-communications packet networks. In this
                 application, the events are packet arrivals at a
                 particular network node, and the labels consist of the
                 source and destination addresses in the packets. The
                 set of all packets with a particular source\slash
                 destination address pair constitutes a session; the
                 more sophisticated congestion-avoidance algorithms
                 require knowledge of the number of active sessions.
                 This knowledge can be provided in an effective and
                 timely manner by the dictionary-hash technique. The
                 technique is configurable to any desired degree of

                 tree file can be done concurrently with
                 user-transaction processing. The conversion process, in
                 general is motivated by a change in database processing
                 requirements. For the first case, efficient sequential
                 access and direct access are originally needed but now
                 only efficient direct access is needed. for the second

                 changing applications. Several existing database
                 systems allow an off-line reorganization to support

                 concurrent conversion for both cases and present an

                 of two different join algorithms on both cube and ring
                 interconnections for message-based multicomputers, and
                 to investigate the effects that the number of
                 processors and the type of interconnection scheme have
                 on the performance. First, the parallel Hybrid-Hash
                 [5], [15] join algorithm and the parallel Join-Index
                 [22] join algorithm for both the cube and ring
                 connected multicomputers are presented. The performance
                 of these algorithms is then compared through analytical
                 cost modeling. The result shows that the Join-Index
                 join algorithm gives good performance only when the
                 join selectivity is very small, and the Hybrid-Hash
                 join algorithm performs consistently well under most
                 situations. Our result also shows that the cube
                 topology yields better execution time than the same
                 algorithm on the ring topology. Furthermore, increasing
                 the number of processors has a more significant
                 improvement on the execution time for the cube than the
                 ring configuration. The applicability of join indexes

                 algorithms on both cube and ring interconnections for
                 message-based multicomputers, and investigate the
                 effects that the number of processors and the type of
                 interconnection scheme have on the performance. First,
                 the parallel hybrid-hash join algorithm and the
                 parallel join-index join algorithm for both the cube
                 and ring connected multicomputers are presented. The
                 performance of these algorithms is then compared
                 through analytical cost modeling. The result shows that
                 the join-index join algorithm gives good performance
                 only when the join selectivity is very small, and the
                 hybrid-hash join algorithm performs consistently well
                 under most situations. It is shown that the cube
                 topology yields better execution time than the same
                 algorithm on the ring topology. Furthermore, increasing
                 the number of processors has a more significant
                 improvement on the execution time of the cube than for
                 the ring configuration. The applicability of join
                 indexes on the parallel database algorithms is also

                 terms of number of clusters accessed for range queries
                 and overhead computation. It was shown that the way a
                 signature is constructed from the individual hash
                 functions can be crucial to the performance of a
                 hashing scheme and therefore it is important to find an
                 optimal ordering of the attributes. The analysis was
                 performed under the assumption of independence of
                 attributes in queries.",

                 determine a hash function that achieves some desired

                 The construction and refinement of a computer graphics
                 scene is unacceptably slow when using ray tracing. We
                 introduce a new technique to speed up the generation of
                 successive ray traced images when the geometry of the
                 scene remains constant and only the light source
                 intensities and the surface properties need to be
                 adjusted. When the scene is first traced, an expression
                 parameterized in the color of all lights and the
                 surface property coefficients of all objects is
                 calculated and stored for each pixel. Redisplaying a
                 scene with a new set of lights and colors then consists
                 of substituting values for the corresponding parameters
                 and re-evaluating the expressions for the pixels. This
                 parameter updating and redisplay takes only a few
                 seconds, as compared to the many minutes or hours
                 required to ray trace the entire scene again, but it
                 uses much more memory and disk space. With suitable
                 expression sharing, however, these storage needs can be
                 reduced to an acceptable level.",

                 unification. However, there can be another approach. By

                 the database can be managed independently of the host

                 pattern associative memory (PAM) which maintains the

                 retrieves them by pattern matching with a high speed.

                 system with a large vocabulary. When the vocabulary is
                 very large, it is difficult to deal with such
                 vocabulary `in-core' as one in a traditional system. In
                 this paper, words are grouped into those of primary
                 importance and those of secondary importance. The
                 former are located in the main memory (i.e. `in-core'),
                 and the latter are located in secondary storage. When
                 the system consults a dictionary, the `in-core' is
                 looked up first, and then the secondary storage is
                 accessed. Efficient access requires a good
                 configuration of the secondary storage. The ordered
                 hashing mechanism is adopted because of its quick
                 access, and because its structure can be uniquely
                 constructed due to the dictionary order. The grammar
                 written by Mizutani is adopted for the system because
                 it has been intended for machine oriented grammar and
                 because the number of the tree structures is less than
                 that of the traditional approach.",

                 currently operating on an Intel iPSC/2 hypercube with
                 32 processors and 32 disk drives. Gamma employs three
                 key technical ideas which enable the architecture to be
                 scaled to 100s of processors. First, all relations are
                 horizontally partitioned across multiple disk drives
                 enabling relations to be scanned in parallel. Second,
                 novel parallel algorithms based on hashing are used to
                 implement the complex relational operators such as join
                 and aggregate functions. Third, dataflow scheduling
                 techniques are used to coordinate multioperator
                 queries. By using these techniques it is possible to
                 control the execution of very complex queries with
                 minimal coordination --- a necessity for configurations
                 involving a very large number of processors. In
                 addition to describing the design of the Gamma
                 software, a thorough performance evaluation of the
                 iPSC/2 hypercube version of Gamma is also presented. In
                 addition to measuring the effect of relation size and
                 indices on the response time for selection, join,
                 aggregation, and update queries, we also analyze the
                 performance of Gamma relative to the number of
                 processors employed when the sizes of the input
                 relations are kept constant (speedup) and when the
                 sizes of the input relations are increased
                 proportionally to the number of processors (scaleup).
                 The speedup results obtained for both selection and
                 join queries are linear; thus, doubling the number of
                 processors halves the response time for a query. The
                 scaleup results obtained are also quite encouraging.
                 They reveal that a nearly constant response time can be
                 maintained for both selection and join queries as the
                 workload is increased by adding a proportional number

                 both direct and sequential access. Indeed, the

                 based on a two-stage abstract parallel processing
                 model. The objective of this model is to maximize
                 throughput and minimize response time. To maximize
                 throughput, lock structures, access structures, and
                 shared variables are distributed among the shared
                 memories. A novel approach based on hash-based parallel
                 accesses is used. The effect of lock conflict is
                 minimized by an optimistic locking protocol. Analytical
                 models are developed for hot spot memory accesses,
                 distributed data accesses, and space-versus-time
                 tradeoffs for fast accesses to records. On the basis of

                 reduce the amount data needs to be searched during
                 query evaluation. Even though several techniques for
                 organizing and searching signature files have been
                 proposed in literature, they have serious limitations
                 when applied to multimedia databases, where integrated
                 access methods to text and image content are needed. A
                 new signature technique, called Quick Filter, is
                 proposed in the paper. According to this technique,
                 signatures are divided into partitions, each of which
                 holds signatures sharing the same characteristic key.
                 As a result, it is possible to determine if the
                 signatures in a partition satisfy a query by merely
                 examining the key. Partitions not matching the key need
                 not be searched. This method is based on dynamic
                 hashing since signatures are hashed into partitions
                 according to the keys and the file size, computed
                 algorithmically from the signatures. Implementation of
                 this technique is illustrated using an example and is
                 verified by analytical performance evaluation. The
                 result is a signature technique which satisfies the
                 requirements for access methods in multimedia

                 been made feasible with the advent of cheap, powerful
                 microprocessors and large main memories. However,
                 exploiting these platforms to support high speed
                 complex query processing has lagged behind the hardware
                 technology. The thrust of this dissertation has
                 concentrated on developing strategies for efficiently
                 processing join queries consisting of on the order of
                 10 joins in a parallel database machine with hundreds
                 of processors. Although the algorithms were developed
                 with a shared-nothing architecture in mind, the
                 algorithms can be applied to shared-memory systems with
                 little modification. For queries that join only a few
                 relations, we have found that the parallel Hybrid
                 hash-join algorithm dominates under most circumstances,
                 except when the join attribute values of the building
                 relation are highly skewed. For multi-way join queries,
                 a subset of the optimization search space of query
                 plans called right-deep query plans is identified as
                 being particularly important in this highly-parallel
                 environment. Several algorithms are proposed for
                 processing right-deep query plans and results from a
                 simulation model are presented that demonstrate that
                 right-deep plans can indeed offer significant
                 performance advantages over the more traditional
                 left-deep plans under many conditions.",

                 and evaluation of join algorithms that exploit large
                 main memories and parallel processors has received a
                 great deal of attention. However, most of this work has
                 addressed the problem of executing joins involving only
                 two relations. In this paper we examine the problem of
                 processing multi-way join queries through hash-based
                 join methods in a shared-nothing database environment.
                 We first discuss how the choice of a format for a
                 complex query can significantly affect performance in a
                 multiprocessor database machine. Experimental results
                 obtained from a simulation study are then presented to
                 demonstrate the tradeoffs of left-deep and right-deep
                 scheduling strategies for complex join query
                 evaluation. These results demonstrate that right-deep
                 scheduling strategies can provide significant

                 machines, even when memory is limited.",

                 To speed up the retrieval operations on very large
                 databases, we propose a hashing scheme named Indexed
                 Extendible Hashing (IEH). Indexed extendible hashing a

                 especially when the distributions of the attribute

                 and direct access, considerable processing time can be

                 large databases. IEH can also be used for

                 relation has been identified as a major performance
                 limiting factor for external parallel join algorithms.
                 The effective parallelism of both sort-merge based and
                 hash based algorithms degrade significantly with skew
                 on the join attribute values as well as skew on the
                 distribution of data among processors. In this paper,
                 we propose an external parallel join algorithm, derived
                 from quick-sort, which performs well even in the case
                 of skew. The algorithm uses range partitioning to split
                 each relation into buckets, where the range values are
                 determined using sampling techniques. Furthermore, each
                 bucket is distributed evenly among all system disks,
                 ensuring that all processors may work in parallel to
                 further partition each bucket. Since both the task of
                 partitioning the relations and the join of the final
                 buckets are evenly distributed over all processors,
                 the problem of skew is solved effectively. Experimental
                 results show that a close to linear speedup can still
                 be obtained even in the case of skew.",

                 compact form, called ``Bonsai'', using hash tables. A
                 method is described that is suitable for large trees
                 that grow monotonically within a predefined maximum
                 size limit. Using it, pointers in any tree can be
                 represented within $6 + ceil$ bits per node where $n$
                 is the maximum number of children a node can have. We
                 first describe a general way of storing trees in hash
                 tables, and then introduce the idea of compact hashing
                 which underlies the Bonsai structure. These two
                 techniques are combined to give a compact
                 representation of trees, and a practical methodology is
                 set out to permit the design of these structures. The
                 new representation is compared with two conventional
                 tree implementations in terms of the storage required
                 per node. Examples of programs that must store large
                 trees within a strict maximum size include those that
                 operate on trie structures derived from natural
                 language text. We describe how the Bonsai technique has
                 been applied to the trees that arise in text
                 compression and adaptive prediction, and include a
                 discussion of the design parameters that work well in

  abstract =     "Hashing schemes have been found to be one of the
                 useful access methods for physical database system
                 implementation. In the last decade several schemes have
                 been proposed to extend the applicability of hashing
                 methods to dynamic files. When a very large database
                 system is considered, besides the space utilization and
                 the retrieval time of the directory also become a major
                 concern. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic
                 hashing scheme, based on extendible hashing, whose
                 directory can grow into a multilevel directory. We
                 compare the proposed scheme to two other schemes, the
                 Extendible hashing and the Extendible Hashing Tree
                 schemes. The simulation results reveal that the
                 proposed scheme is superior than the other two in the
                 aspect of directory space utilization, especially for
                 files with nonuniform record distribution. Furthermore,
                 this scheme can be easily extended to multikey file
                 systems and also has good performance.",

  abstract =     "Rapid access to information is essential for a wide
                 variety of retrieval systems and applications. Hashing
                 has long been used when the fastest possible direct
                 search is desired, but is generally not appropriate
                 when sequential or range searches are also required.
                 This paper describes a hashing method, developed for
                 collections that are relatively static, that supports
                 both direct and sequential access. The algorithms
                 described give hash functions that are optimal in terms
                 of time and hash table space utilization, and that
                 preserve any a priori ordering desired. Furthermore,
                 the resulting order-preserving minimal perfect hash
                 functions (OPMPHFs) can be found using time and space
                 that are linear in the number of keys involved; this is

                 relational database systems, only sort-based algorithms

  abstract =     "Prior to this work, all implementations of stack
                 simulation required more than linear time to process an
                 address trace. In particular these implementations are
                 often slow for highly-associative memories and traces
                 with poor locality, as can be found in simulations of
                 file systems. We describe a new implementation of stack
                 simulation where the referenced block and its stack
                 distance are found using a hash table rather than by
                 traversing the stack. This allows the trace-driven
                 simulation of multiple alternative memories with the
                 same block size, the same number of sets (e.g., fully
                 associative), and using the least-recently-used
                 replacement policy, with one pass through the trace in
                 linear time. The key to this implementation is that
                 designers are rarely interested in a continuum of
                 memory sizes, but instead desire metrics for only a
                 small, discrete set of alternatives (e.g., powers of
                 two). We determine the memories in which a block
                 resides by augmenting the state of each block with an
                 index to the largest memory that contains that block.

                 of supporting voice in broadband ISDN's (B-ISDN)
                 asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), including voice
                 compression. Techniques for voice compression with
                 variable-length packet format at DS1 transmission rate
                 [e.g., wideband packet technology (WPT)] have been
                 successfully implemented utilizing embedded ADPCM
                 coding, digital speech interpolation (DSI), and
                 block-dropping schemes. For supporting voice in B-ISDN,
                 we consider voice compression techniques similar to
                 those use in WPT but with different packetization and
                 congestion control methods designed for the
                 fixed-length ATM protocol. Possible approaches for
                 packetization and implementation of variable bit-rate
                 voice coding schemes are described. We consider using
                 ADPCM and DSI for voice coding and compression, and
                 cell discarding (CD) for congestion control. The
                 advantages of voice compression and cell discarding in

                 relational join algorithms for large databases on a
                 hypercube multicomputer in which data and processing
                 power are distributed. The Cube Hybrid-Hash join
                 algorithm was shown to outperform other algorithms in
                 our previous research. Unfortunately, its performance
                 greatly deteriorates when bucket overflow occurs in the
                 inner rlation of the join operation. In this paper, we
                 present the Cube Adaptive-Hash join algorithm, which is
                 designed to combine the merits of Nested-Loop and
                 Hybrid-Hash. The performance of these algorithms are
                 compared through analytical cost modeling. The
                 non-uniform data value distribution of the inner
                 relation is shown to have a greater impact than that of
                 the outer relation. The Cube Adaptive-Hash join
                 algorithm outperforms the Cube Hybrid-Hash algorithm
                 when bucket overflow occurs. In the worst case, this
                 algorithm converges to the Cube Nested-Loop-Hash join
                 algorithm. When there is no hash table overflow, the
                 Cube Adaptive-Hash join algorithm converges to the Cube
                 Hybrid-Hash join algorithm. Since the Cube
                 Adaptive-Hash join algorithm adapts itself depending on
                 the characteristics of the relations, it is relatively
                 immune to the data distribution. We believe that the
                 Cube Adaptive-Hash join algorithm should be the
                 algorithm of choice to perform the relational join
                 operator for large databases on the hypercube

                 Efficient parallel algorithms have been designed for

  abstract =     "Database systems have traditionally been designed for
                 business applications. In the last decade, however, it
                 has become increasingly clear that application areas
                 such as computer-aided design and manufacturing
                 (CAD/CAM), computer-aided software engineering (CASE),
                 image processing, etc., can also benefit from database
                 technology. Unfortunately, the relational database
                 systems that are used for business applications are
                 often ill suited for these sorts of applications. More
                 recently, several `next-generation' database systems,
                 which are often classified as extended relational
                 database systems or object-oriented database systems,
                 have appeared to address the demands of these emerging
                 application areas. Of course, whether these
                 next-generation database systems actually succeed will
                 largely depend on their performance. This thesis
                 describes and analyzes three different implementation
                 techniques for improving the performance of
                 next-generation database systems. A separate research
                 chapter is devoted to each technique. In the first
                 research chapter of this thesis, we describe a
                 technique called {\it field replication,} which uses
                 replicated data to eliminate some of the functional
                 joins that would otherwise be required for query
                 processing. We describe how field replication is
                 specified at the data model level and present
                 storage-level mechanisms to efficiently support it. An
                 analytical cost model is developed to give some feel
                 for how beneficial this technique can be and the
                 circumstances under which it breaks down. While field
                 replication is a relatively simple notion, the analysis
                 shows that it can provide significant performance gains
                 in many situations. In the second research chapter of
                 this thesis, we examine how physical pointers can be
                 used effectively in join processing. We describe
                 several pointer-based join algorithms that are simple
                 variations on the well known nested-loops, sort-merge,
                 hybrid-hash, and hash-loops join algorithms used in
                 relational database systems. An analytical cost model
                 is developed to compare the performance of the
                 pointer-based join algorithms to their standard
                 counterparts. The results of the analysis show that the
                 pointer-based algorithms can often provide significant
                 performance gains over conventional, value-based join
                 algorithms. In the final research chapter of this
                 thesis, we argue that traditional database storage
                 systems are poorly suited for some emerging application
                 areas such as CAD/CAM, and that an approach based on a
                 single-level store may offer better performance. We
                 describe a prototype storage system called Cricket that
                 was developed to explore the feasibility of such an
                 approach. Cricket uses the memory management primitives
                 of the Mach operating system to provide the abstraction
                 of a shared, transactional, single-level store.
                 Performance results for the Sun Benchmarks indicate
                 that the approach taken in Cricket has the potential to
                 perform well on applications whose working sets fit in
                 memory.",

  abstract =     "In this paper, we compare the performance of several
                 concurrency control protocols by executing these
                 protocols under various workloads in a common
                 distributed database testbed environment. We study the
                 effect of implementation overhead on the performance of
                 three classes of distributed concurrency control
                 protocols: two-phase locking, optimistic approach with
                 backward validation, and optimistic approach with
                 forward validation. We develop and evaluate several
                 optimizations for optimistic concurrency control with
                 backward validation. To minimize the non-essential
                 variations in implementation, we use a common hash
                 table implementation for both the lock table as well as
                 the validation table. The main emphasis here is to
                 contrast the difference in protocol overhead based on
                 the number of high level operations required by
                 different protocols while taking the common low level
                 implementation overhead into consideration. We believe
                 that this is one of the first comprehensive, {\it
                 experimental} study of distributed concurrency control
                 protocols. In our experimental environment, two-phase
                 locking performed significantly better than the
                 backward validation optimistic approaches on most of
                 the workloads (except for read-only workloads). For
                 query-intensive (read-only) workloads, optimistic
                 protocols with backward validation can simplify their
                 validation check and outperform both two-phase locking
                 and the optimistic with forward validation. Two-phase
                 locking also performed better than optimistic with
                 forward validation. Two-phase locking also performed
                 better than optimistic with forward validation (except
                 for the long response time situations). We observed
                 that the locking protocol usually required less system
                 resources (CPU and Disk I/O) than the optimistic
                 approaches and supported higher throughput. On some of
                 the workloads, the most important performance
                 degradation factor for the two-phase locking protocol
                 was a long blocking time on locks whereas it was the
                 high transaction abort rate for the optimistic
                 protocols, especially for the ones with backward
                 validation.",

                 convenient indexing technique, in particular for text
                 data. Because it can deal with unformatted data, many
                 application domains have shown interest in signature
                 file techniques, e.g., office information systems,
                 statistical and logic databases. We argue that
                 multimedia databases should also take advantage of this
                 method, provided convenient storage structures for
                 organizing signature files are available. Our main
                 concern here is the dynamic organization of signatures
                 based on a partitioning paradigm called Quick Filter. A
                 signature file is partitioned by a hashing function and
                 the partitions are organized by linear hashing.
                 Thorough performance evaluation of the new scheme is

                 parallel joins in database systems. Our approach is
                 easily implementable within current parallel DBMS, and
                 performs well on skewed data without degrading the
                 performance of the system on non-skewed data. The main
                 idea is to use multiple algorithms, each specialized
                 for a different degree of skew, and to use a small
                 sample of the relations being joined to determine which
                 algorithm is appropriate. We developed, implemented,
                 and experimented with four new skew-handling parallel
                 join algorithms; one, which we call virtual processor
                 range partitioning, was the clear winner in high skew
                 cases, while traditional hybrid hash join was the clear
                 winner in lower skew or no skew cases. We present
                 experimental results from an implementation of all four
                 algorithms on the Gamma parallel database machine. To
                 our knowledge, these are the first reported
                 skew-handling numbers from an actual implementation.",

                 The advent of object-oriented and extensible database

                 (1) the structure captures the hashed order in

                 systems, expressions and function definitions are often
                 defined as terms, that is as trees. Similarly, the

                 objects are increasingly needed in many different
                 fields, such as office automation, knowledge
                 processing, CAD, CAM, CASE, etc. A lot of recent
                 complex object database systems support the concepts of
                 object identity and object identifier. Following an
                 object identifier to access the referenced object is
                 called navigation operation and is an essential
                 operation in dealing with complex objects. Navigation
                 operation is a difficult operation to implement
                 efficiently since every navigation operation inherently
                 causes one disk access operation. This paper proposes a
                 scheme to notably accelerate the navigation operation
                 among a sea of complex objects, by increasing the
                 effective number of objects in one disk page. The main
                 concept of the presented technique is threefold. The
                 first idea is to store a cache value within a complex
                 object that is referencing another complex object. The
                 second is that when the referenced object is to be
                 updated the update propagation is delayed until the
                 time when the cached value is referenced. The third is
                 to utilize a hashed table on main memory to efficiently
                 validate the consistency between the cached values and
                 the original values.",

                 type-graphs (tgraphs), which are rooted directed graphs
                 with order among the edges leaving each node. Tgraphs
                 are uniquely mapped into polynomials which, in turn,
                 are each evaluated at a special point to yield an
                 irrational number named the tgraph's {\em magic
                 number}. This special point is chosen using the
                 Schanuel conjecture. It is shown that each tgraph can
                 be uniquely represented by this magic number; namely,
                 types are equal if and only if the corresponding magic
                 numbers are equal. Since irrational numbers require
                 infinite precision, the algorithm for generating magic
                 numbers is carried out using a double-precision
                 floating-point approximation. This approximation is
                 viewed as a hashing scheme, mapping the infinite domain
                 of the irrational numbers into finite computer words.
                 The proposed hashing scheme was investigated
                 experimentally, with the conclusion that it is a good
                 and practical hashing method. In tests involving over a
                 million randomly chosen tgraphs, we have not
                 encountered a single collision. We conclude that this
                 method for representation and management of types is
                 practical, and offers novel possibilities for enforcing
                 strict type matching at link time among separately

                 new encryption primitive, which encrypts and decrypts a
                 64-bit block of data using a 64-bit key. Furthermore
                 they propose a way to build private versions of LOKI.
                 In this paper we show first that the keyspace of any
                 LOKI-version is only 2p60s, not 2p64 sas claimed.
                 Therefore there are 15 equivalent keys for every key,
                 that encrypts/decrypts texts the same way. An immediate
                 consequence is, that the proposed Single Block Hash
                 Mode is no good. It is very easy to find collisions.
                 Secondly we do differential cryptanalysis on LOKI and
                 show that n-round LOKI, n [< or =] 14 is vulnerable to
                 this kind of attack, at least in principle. We show
                 that we cannot find a characteristic with a probability
                 high enough to break LOKI with 16 rounds. However one
                 might find a private LOKI-version, that is vulnerable
                 to a differential attack for n=16. Finally we consider

  abstract =     "Previous work on superimposed coding has been
                 characterized by two aspects. First, it is generally
                 assumed that signatures are generated from {\em
                 logical\/} text blocks of the same size; that is, each
                 block contains the same number of unique terms after
                 stopword and duplicate removal. We call this approach
                 the fixed-size block (FSB) method, since each text
                 block has the same size, as measured by the number of
                 unique terms contained in it. Second, with only a few
                 exceptions [6,7,8,9,17], most previous work has assumed
                 that each term in the text contributes the same number
                 of ones to the signature (i.e., the weight of the term
                 signatures is fixed). The main objective of this paper
                 is to derive an optimal weight assignment that assigns
                 weights to document terms according to their occurrence
                 and query frequencies in order to minimize the
                 false-drop probability. The optimal scheme can account
                 for both uniform and nonuniform occurrence and query
                 frequencies, and the signature generation method is
                 still based on hashing rather than on table lookup.
                 Furthermore, a new way of generating signatures, the
                 fixed-weight block (FWB) method, is introduced. FWB
                 controls the weight of {\em every\/} signature to a
                 constant, whereas in FSB, only the {\em expected\/}
                 signature weight is constant. We have shown that FWB
                 has a lower false-drop probability than that of the FSB
                 method, but its storage overhead is slightly higher.
                 Other advantages of FWB are that the optimal weight
                 assignment can be obtained analytically without making
                 unrealistic assumptions and that the formula for
                 computing the term signature weights is simple and
                 efficient.",

  abstract =     "The goal of this research is to design efficient
                 relational join algorithms for large databases on a
                 hypercube multicomputer in which data and processing
                 power are distributed. The Cube Hybrid-Hash join
                 algorithm was shown to outperform other algorithms in
                 our previous research. Unfortunately, its performance
                 greatly deteriorates when bucket overflow occurs in the
                 inner relation of the join operation. In this paper, we
                 present the Cube Adaptive-Hash join algorithm, which is
                 designed to combine the merit of Nested-Loop and
                 Hybrid-Hash. The performance of these algorithms are
                 compared through analytical cost modeling. The
                 nonuniform data value distribution of the inner
                 relation is shown to have a greater impact than that of
                 the outer relation. The Cube Adaptive-Hash join
                 algorithm outperforms the Cube Hybrid-Hash join
                 algorithm when bucket overflow occurs. In the worst
                 case, this algorithm converges to the Cube
                 Nested-Loop-Hash join algorithm. When there is no hash
                 table overflow, the Cube Adaptive-Hash join algorithm
                 converges to the Cube Hybrid-Hash join algorithm. Since
                 the Cube Adaptive-Hash join algorithm adapts itself
                 depending on the characteristics of the relations, it
                 is relatively immune to the data distribution. We
                 believe that the Cube Adaptive-Hash join algorithm
                 should be the algorithm of choice to perform the
                 relational join operator for large databases on the
                 hypercube multicomputer.",

                 physically distributed memory, it may be advantageous
                 to hash the address space to prevent network congestion
                 and memory bank contention. The decision whether or not

                 the network and the locality of memory accesses in the
                 algorithm. A complexity-theoretic basis for this
                 decision is provided by the Block PRAM model of
                 Aggarwal, Chandra and Snir, a shared-memory model of
                 parallel computation which accounts for communication
                 locality. For this model, we exhibit a universal family
                 of hash functions having optimal locality. The
                 complexity of applying these hash functions to the
                 shared address space of the Block PRAM (i.e., by
                 permuting data elements) is asymptotically equivalent
                 to the complexity of performing a square matrix
                 transpose, and this result is best possible for all
                 pairwise independent universal hash families.",

  abstract =     "New applications such as CAD, AI, and hypermedia
                 require direct representation and flexible use of
                 complex objects, behavioral knowledge, and multimedia
                 data. To this end, we have devised a knowledge base
                 management system called Jasmine. An object-oriented
                 approach in a programming language also seems promising
                 for use in Jasmine. Jasmine extends the current
                 object-oriented approach and provides the following
                 features. Our object model is based on functional data
                 models and well-established set theory. Attributes or
                 functions composing objects can represent both
                 structural and behavioral knowledge. The object model
                 can represent incomplete and generic knowledge. The
                 model can support the basic storage and operations of
                 multimedia data. The facets of attributes can flexibly
                 represent constraints and triggers. The object
                 manipulation language can support associative access of
                 objects. The structural and behavioral knowledge can be
                 uniformly treated to allow the user to specify complex
                 object operations in a compact manner. The user-defined
                 and system-defined attributes can be uniformly
                 specified to ease user customization of the language.
                 The classes and instances can be uniformly accessed.
                 Incomplete knowledge can be flexibly accessed. The
                 system has a layered architecture. Objects are stored
                 in nested relations provided by extensive DBMS as a
                 sublayer. User query of objects is compiled into
                 relational operations such as select and join, which
                 can be efficiently processed using hashing. The
                 behavioral knowledge is compiled into predicate and
                 manipulation function interfaces that can directly
                 access tuples in a buffer.",

                 Machine (DMM). In a PRAM, memory conflicts occur only
                 through concurrent access to the same cell, whereas the
                 memory of a DMM is divided into modules, one for each
                 processor, and concurrent accesses to the same module
                 create a conflict. The delay of a simulation is the
                 time needed to simulate a parallel memory access of the
                 PRAM. Any general simulation of an m processor PRAM on
                 a n processor DMM will necessarily have delay at least
                 m/n. A randomized simulation is called time-processor
                 optimal if the delay is O(m/n) with high probability.
                 Using a novel simulation scheme based on hashing we
                 obtain a time-processor optimal simulation with delay
                 O($\backslash$loglog(n)$\backslash$logstn). The best

  abstract =     "A parallel program P is {\em large-grained\/} if the
                 instructions constituting its individual threads are
                 complex procedures requiring numerous processor
                 instructions. This practically relevant style arises
                 naturally in the context of parallel data-processing
                 programs and large scale parallel numerical
                 computations, and large-granularity has been proposed
                 as a means of coping with communication overheads via
                 {\em latency masking}. It is distinct from classical
                 models of parallel computing in that within a parallel
                 step the computations on different threads may
                 considerably vary in size. We present a transformation
                 (compilation) of a large-grained program P into a
                 program C(P) which correctly and efficiently effects
                 the computation of P on an asynchronous machine M. Let
                 W denote the total work required to execute P on a
                 synchronous n-processor parallel system. Under moderate
                 assumptions on the granularity of threads and the size
                 of the program variables, an execution of C(P) on M
                 requires just $O(W\log^*n)$ expected total work, and
                 the memory space overhead is a small multiplicative
                 constant. The solution involves a number of new
                 concepts and methods which we feel are of independent
                 interest, including methods for storing program and
                 control variables, employing a combination of error
                 correction codes with phase--dependent hashing into
                 memory, and novel notions of stability in asynchronous

  abstract =     "The subject of this thesis is the study of
                 cryptographic hash functions. The importance of hash
                 functions for protecting the authenticity of
                 information is demonstrated. Applications include
                 integrity protection, conventional message
                 authentication and digital signatures. Theoretical
                 results on cryptographic hash functions are reviewed.
                 The information theoretic approach to authentication is
                 described, and the practicality of schemes based on
                 universal hash functions is studied. An overview is
                 given of the complexity theoretical definitions and
                 constructions. The main contribution of this thesis
                 lies in the study of practical constructions for hash
                 functions. A general model for hash functions is
                 proposed and taxonomy for attacks is presented. Then
                 all schemes in the literature are divided into three
                 classes: hash functions based on block ciphers, hash
                 functions based on modular arithmetic and dedicated
                 hash functions. An overview is given of existing
                 attacks, new attacks are demonstrated, and new schemes
                 are proposed. The study of basic building blocks of
                 cryptographic hash functions leads to the study of the
                 cryptographic properties of Boolean functions. New
                 criteria are defined and functions satisfying new and
                 existing criteria are studied.",

  abstract =     "A non-equijoin of relations R and S is a based join if
                 the join predicate requires values in the join
                 attribute of R to fall within a specified band about
                 the values in the join attributes of S. This paper
                 describes a new algorithm, termed a truncating-hash
                 band join, for evaluating band joins. This algorithm is
                 based on the idea of truncating join attribute values
                 in order to execute band joins in a way similar to hash
                 join algorithms for equijoins. Unlike previously
                 proposed algorithms for band joins, it does not sort
                 either of the input relations during its execution. We
                 present a comparison between the truncating-hash band
                 join algorithm and previous algorithms for band joins
                 using an analytical model. The model also compares an
                 evaluation of band join algorithms for parallel
                 implementation on a `shared-nothing' multiprocessor
                 system. The results show that the truncating-hash band
                 join algorithm outperforms the other band algorithms
                 because of a significantly lower CPU cost.",

                 consisting of many small boxes, connected by a known
                 graph structure, so that the boxes can be evaluated
                 forward and backwards by given oracles. We study
                 attacks that work for any choice of the black boxes,
                 i.e. we scrutinize the given graph structure. For
                 example we analyze the graph of the fast Fourier
                 transform (FFT). We present optimal black box
                 inversions of FFT-compression functions and black box
                 constructions of collisions. This determines the
                 minimal depth of FFT-compression networks for
                 collision-resistant hashing. We propose the concept of
                 multipermutation, which is a pair of orthogonal latin
                 squares, as a new cryptographic primitive that
                 generalizes the boxes of the FFT. Our examples of
                 multipermutations are based on the operations circular
                 rotation, bitwise xor, addition and multiplication.",

                 independent optimizations (e.g., conditional constant
                 propagation, global value numbering) and code motion
                 issues separately. Removing the code motion
                 requirements from the machine independent optimizations
                 allows stronger optimizations using simpler algorithms.
                 Preserving a legal schedule is one of the prime sources
                 of complexity in algorithms like PRE (E. Morel and C.
                 Renvoise, 1979) or global congruence finding (B. Alpern
                 et al., 1988). We present a straightforward near linear
                 time algorithm for performing global code motion (GCM).
                 Our GCM algorithm hoists code out of loops and pushes
                 it into more control dependent (and presumably less
                 frequently executed) basic blocks. GCM is not optimal
                 in the sense that it may lengthen some paths; it hoists
                 control dependent code out of loops. This is profitable
                 if the loop executes at least once; frequently it is
                 very profitable. GCM relies only on dependences between
                 instructions; the original schedule order is ignored.
                 GCM moves instructions, but it does not alter the
                 control flow graph (CFG) nor remove redundant code. GCM
                 benefits from CFG shaping (such as splitting control
                 dependent edges, or inserting loop landing pads). GCM
                 allows us to use a simple hash based technique for
                 global value numbering (GVN).",

  abstract =     "Universal quantification is not supported directly in
                 most database systems despite the fact that it adds
                 significant power to a system's query processing and
                 inference capabilities, in particular for the analysis
                 of many-to-many relationships and of set-valued
                 attributes. One of the main reasons for this omission
                 has been that universal quantification algorithms and
                 their performance have not been explored for large
                 databases. In this article, we describe and compare
                 three known algorithms and one recently proposed
                 algorithm for relational division, the algebra operator
                 that embodies universal quantification. For each
                 algorithm, we investigate the performance effects of
                 explicit duplicate removal and referential integrity
                 enforcement, variants for inputs larger than memory,
                 and parallel execution strategies. Analytical and
                 experimental performance comparisons illustrate the
                 substantial differences among the algorithms. Moreover,
                 comparisons demonstrate that the recently proposed
                 division algorithm evaluates a universal quantification
                 predicate over two relations as fast as hash (semi-)
                 join evaluates an existential quantification predicate
                 over the same relations. Thus, existential and
                 universal quantification can be supported with equal
                 efficiency by adding the recently proposed algorithm to
                 a query evaluation system. A second result of our study
                 is that universal quantification should be expressed
                 directly in a database query language, because most
                 query optimizers do not recognize the rather indirect
                 formulations available in SQL as relational division
                 and therefore produce very poor evaluation plans for
                 many universal quantification queries.",

  abstract =     "Parallelizing logic programming has attracted much
                 interest in the research community, because of the
                 intrinsic OR- and AND-parallelisms of logic programs.
                 One research stream aims at transparent exploitation of
                 parallelism in existing logic programming languages
                 such as Prolog, while the family of concurrent logic
                 languages develops language constructs allowing
                 programmers to express the concurrency---that is, the
                 communication and synchronization between parallel
                 processes---within their algorithms. This article
                 concentrates mainly on transparent exploitation of
                 parallelism and surveys the most mature solutions to
                 the problems to be solved in order to obtain efficient
                 implementations. These solutions have been implemented,
                 and the most efficient parallel logic programming
                 systems reach effective speedups over state-of-the-art
                 sequential Prolog implementations. The article also
                 addresses current and prospective research issues in
                 extending the applicability and the efficiency of
                 existing systems, such as models merging the
                 transparent parallelism and the concurrent logic
                 languages approaches, combination of constraint logic
                 programming with parallelism, and use of highly

                 weight-partitioned signature file, for supporting
                 document ranking is proposed. It employs multiple
                 signature files, each of which corresponds to one term
                 frequency, to represent terms with different term
                 frequencies. Words with the same term frequency in a
                 document are grouped together and hashed into the
                 signature file corresponding to that term frequency.
                 This eliminates the need to record the term frequency
                 explicitly for each word. We investigate the effect of
                 false drops on retrieval effectiveness if they are not
                 eliminated in the search process. We have shown that
                 false drops introduce insignificant degradation on
                 precision and recall when the false-drop probability is
                 below a certain threshold. This is an important result
                 since false-drop elimination could become the
                 bottleneck in systems using fast signature file search
                 techniques. We perform an analytical study on the
                 performance of the weight-partitioned signature file
                 under different search strategies and configurations.
                 An optimal formula is obtained to determine for a fixed
                 total storage overhead the storage to be allocated to
                 each partition in order to minimize the effect of false
                 drops on document ranks. Experiments were performed

  abstract =     "We present a scalable distributed data structure
                 called LH*. LH* generalizes Linear Hashing (LH) to
                 distributed RAM and disk files. An LH* file can be
                 created from records with primary keys, or objects with
                 OIDs, provided by any number of distributed and
                 autonomous clients. It does not require a central
                 directory, and grows gracefully, through splits of one
                 bucket at a time, to virtually any number of servers.
                 The number of messages per random insertion is one in
                 general, and three in the worst case, regardless of the
                 file size. The number of messages per key search is two
                 in general, and four in the worst case. The file
                 supports parallel operations, e.g., hash joins and
                 scans. Performing a parallel operation on a file of $M$
                 buckets costs at most 2 $M$ + 1 messages, and between 1
                 and $O$ (log 2 $M$) rounds of messages.\par We first
                 describe the basic LH* scheme where a coordinator site
                 manages abucket splits, and splits a bucket every time
                 a collision occurs. We show that the average load
                 factor of an LH* file is 65%-70% regardless of file
                 size, and bucket capacity. We then enhance the scheme
                 with load control, performed at no additional message
                 cost. The average load factor then increases to 80-95%.
                 These values are about that of LH, but the load factor
                 for LH* varies more.\par We nest define LH* schemes
                 without a coordinator. We show that insert and search
                 costs are the same as for the basic scheme. The
                 splitting cost decreases on the average, but becomes
                 more variable, as cascading splits are needed to
                 prevent file overload. Next, we briefly describe two
                 variants of splitting policy, using parallel splits and
                 presplitting that should enhance performance for
                 high-performance applications.\par All together, we
                 show that LH* files can efficiently scale to files that
                 are orders of magnitude larger in size than single-site
                 files. LH* files that reside in main memory may also be
                 much faster than single-site disk files. Finally, LH*
                 files can be more efficient than any distributed file
                 with a centralized directory, or a static parallel or
                 distributed hash file.",

                 basic ideas behind the algorithms date back at least to
                 the 1960s, but their practical utility has been

                 symbols. The fastest method of implementing such
                 operations is through the use of hash tables. Rapid
                 hashing of consecutive n-grams is best done using a
                 recursive hash function, in which the hash value of the
                 current n-gram is derived from the hash value of its
                 predecessor. This article generalizes recursive hash
                 functions found in the literature and proposes new
                 methods offering superior performance. Experimental

  abstract =     "With the profusion of text databases on the Internet,
                 it is becoming increasingly hard to find the most
                 useful databases for a given query. To attack this
                 problem, several existing and proposed systems employ
                 brokers to direct user queries, using a local database
                 of summary information about the available databases.
                 This summary information must effectively distinguish
                 relevant databases and must be compact while allowing
                 efficient access. We offer evidence that one broker,
                 GlOSS, can be effective at locating databases of
                 interest even in a system of hundreds of databases and
                 can examine the performance of accessing the GlOSS
                 summaries for two promising storage methods: the grid
                 file and partitioned hashing. We show that both methods
                 can be tuned to provide good performance for a
                 particular workload (within a broad range of
                 workloads), and we discuss the tradeoffs between the
                 two data structures. As a side effect of our work, we
                 show that grid files are more broadly applicable than
                 previously thought; in particular, we show that by
                 varying the policies used to construct the grid file we
                 can provide good performance for a wide range of
                 workloads even when storing highly skewed data.",

                 supernode can be mapped into a logic module by looking
                 up an extended GBDD hash table. The use of this table
                 look-up matching can shorten the matching time
                 significantly. As shown in the experiments, the average

                 larger and faster, and addresses increasing in size,
                 has impelled a need to explore alternatives for fast
                 address recognition. Hashing is one such alternative
                 which can help minimize the address search time in
                 adapters, bridges, routers, gateways, and name servers.
                 Using a trace of address references, we compared the
                 efficiency of several different hashing functions and
                 found that the cyclic redundancy checking (CRC)
                 polynomials provide excellent hashing functions. For
                 software implementation, Fletcher checksum provides a
                 good hashing function. Straightforward folding of
                 address octets using the exclusive-or operation is also
                 a good hashing function. For some applications, bit
                 extraction from the address can be used. [{\it Ed.

                 The amount of storage space allocated to the file grows

                 other form of access table is used, retrieval of a
                 record requires only one access in most cases. The
