\begin{abstract}
A data structure, called a \emph{biased range tree}, 
is presented that preprocesses a set $S$ of $n$ points in $\R^2$
and a query distribution $D$ for 2-sided orthogonal range counting
queries.  The expected query time for this data structure under the
distribution $D$ is competitive with the optimal decision tree for $S$
and $D$.   The memory and preprocessing requirements of the data
structure are $O(n\log n)$.
