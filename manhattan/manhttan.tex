\maketitle

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ and let
$p_1,\ldots,p_n$ be a set of points in $\R^2$.  We consider the
problem of embedding $G$ in the plane so that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $v_i$ is drawn as a point at location $p_i$,
\item $e_i$ is drawn as an $x$ and $y$ monotone curve, and
\item no two edges intersect except possibly at their common endpoints.
\end{enumerate}
